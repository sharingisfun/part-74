By the 13th century this revision had come to be called the versio vulgata, that is, the &quot;commonly used translation&quot;, and ultimately it became the definitive and officially promulgated Latin version of the Holy Bible in the Catholic Church.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abac8e5b8f5dc19891353b30eb1d6511b6c222f4","amp;dn":"The+Latin+Vulgate+Bible++Biblia+Sacra+.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abac8e5b8f5dc19891353b30eb1d6511b6c222f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,172,142,91,143,93,193,152,145,53,59,48,235,29,101,17,182,194,34,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
