Sorry but I do not own this CD, that is why the bit rate is lower than the others.  I scanned all of the covers at multiple resolutions and all of the mp3 tags are updated and perfectly saved.  \n\nNOTE: I am missing their 2004 release entitled The Bridge and would appreciate it if someone would upload it. \n \nIncluded in this torrent (all @320 unless otherwise indicated):\n\n707-707 (1980)\n707-The Second Album (1981)\n707-Megaforce (1982)\n707-Trip To Heaven (2000) (Ripped @192)\n707-The Fourth Decade (2006)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20a33d5eb3c9c89e7048313932357403882d51b","amp;dn":"707-%5B5+of+6+Studio+Discography%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20a33d5eb3c9c89e7048313932357403882d51b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,10,51,213,235,60,156,137,231,4,131,19,147,35,87,64,56,130,213,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
