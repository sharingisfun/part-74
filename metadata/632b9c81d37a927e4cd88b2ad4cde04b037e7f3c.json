The restaurant is run by 38-year-old Sachie who wishes to offer her Finnish patrons not only Japanese food but Japanese-style food for the soul, too. Attracting Finns to the small restaurant run by a lone Japanese woman proves quite difficult, however.\n\nLuckily Sachie gets to know Midori and her restaurantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only customer, Tommi Hiltunen, with the help of whom she slowly begins to bring in more customers and settle down in her new life. Kamome Shokudo is a charming tale of people in the middle of a foreign culture. The film is based on a novel by popular Japanese writer Yoko Mure. Director Naoko Ogigami received an award at the Berlin International Film Festival for her previous film Barber Yoshino.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0483022/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0483022/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://asianwiki.com/Naoko_Ogigami&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://asianwiki.com/Naoko_Ogigami&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--\n\nDVD-rip (FairUse Wizard 2.11b)\nFormat: MKV\nVideo codec: H264 @ 1215 Kbps / 688x368 / 23.976 fps\nAudio codec: AC3 @ 384 Kbps / 48 KHz\nDuration: 1:41:53\nLanguage: Japanese/Finnish\nSubtitles: English + French (srt)\nFile size: 1.14 Gb\n\n--\n\nKEEP CALM AND SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:632b9c81d37a927e4cd88b2ad4cde04b037e7f3c","amp;dn":"Kamome+Shokudo+%5BNaoko+Ogigami%2C+2006%5D+H264-AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"632b9c81d37a927e4cd88b2ad4cde04b037e7f3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,43,156,129,211,122,146,126,76,216,139,42,212,205,224,75,3,126,127,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
