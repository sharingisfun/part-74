It was self released on January 10, 2005. It is mostly piano based except for guitar accompanied &quot;A Bird's Song&quot; and the surprisingly divergent finale &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot; which is reminiscent of one of Sam Brown's ukulele songs, &quot;I'll Be Here&quot;. The album is filled with driving rhythm, lively and pulsing bass lines, melodious vocals, and beautiful harmonies. All of it executed with Ingrid's consistent vivacity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca8b8597685147541993e46dd80c5cf11bb9970","amp;dn":"Ingrid+Michaelson+-+Slow+the+Rain+%5B2005%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca8b8597685147541993e46dd80c5cf11bb9970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,168,184,89,118,133,20,117,65,153,62,70,221,128,197,207,17,187,153,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
