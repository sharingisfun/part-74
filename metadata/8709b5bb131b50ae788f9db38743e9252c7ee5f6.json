Pause for reflection at the path while birds flutter past and deer graze contentedly in the rich foliage and quiet solitude of the undisturbed woods.\n\nChoose the Natural theme, and your forest becomes pristine as you discover a cascading waterfall. Or, rest at your private cabin before setting out on a hike through the woods at the pathway signs - it's all up to you!\n\nInteract with the birds and watch the deer gaze at the forest. Customize the wildlife, flowers, cabin, signs, grass, waterfall, and much more!\n\nSeveral optional add-on packs are also available for purchase, allowing you to choose the features most meaningful to you:\n\n* The Ã¢â‚¬ËœField PackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ allows you to explore a completely new scene featuring a field of tall waving grass, butterflies, additional deer, and more.\n* In the Ã¢â‚¬ËœStream PackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, just one of the new features is a babbling brook winding through the forest while a buck sips from the clear waters in changing weather conditions, fish, and more.\n* The Ã¢â‚¬ËœCustomization PackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features even more personalization options such as your own text and images in the scene, dynamic time of day, fireflies at night, and more.\n\nThis visually stunning live wallpaper is true 3D with hand-crafted artwork.
