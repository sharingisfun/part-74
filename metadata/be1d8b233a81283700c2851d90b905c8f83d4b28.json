Jessica Jones and Katherine Blamire might hail from Sussex but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d equally call America their home: they got their big break at SXSW and lived in New Orleans for a number of years before releasing their enchantingly folk-ish debut Through Low Lights and Trees. Ever since theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve acquired seeing an ever-increasing fanbase, most notably Jack White, who liked them so much that he released one of their singles on his Third Man Label in 2009 and also invited them to support him on this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo tour.\n\nYou can still see clearly here, on their second full-length, why White liked them so much. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Three of UsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for example, its heavy bluesy guitar bearing the slightest resemblance to The Stone RosesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove SpreadsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ whilst keeping the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usual autumnal tones. Older fans find it a departure - in the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press release, Blamire said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve become more confident in what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing, and so weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve pushed things a bit more. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gotten bolder with the dynamics, and our influences have broadened.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Admittedly though, the track does feel a bit mismatched compared to the LPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other sauntering folk songs.\n\nNot like that matters here though, especially when you get songs of the quality of the ghostly strings of Ã¢â‚¬ËœFeel it Coming Near,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the ethereal ritualistic chants of the title track or the PJ Harvey moodiness of Ã¢â‚¬ËœVersion of the Future.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nIn the latter track, they glumly touch upon broken dreams (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a version of the future hanging close above my head / I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get to itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and it is similar melancholic themes throughout which betray the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s otherwise calm and pure dulcets. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAwake,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ like its lilting instrumentation, takes an almost ghostly take on loss (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Are you awake? / Do you feel the space that was once felt by me?&quot;), whereas Ã¢â‚¬ËœDaylightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with its swaying keys and sweeping percussion, mournfully contemplates an existential crisis (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is this the year we lost our direction?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this element of grimness which one would suspect had made them such an attractive act for White in the first place.\n\nBlood Speaks a largely timeless-feeling piece which not only sounds like it could have been written any decade over the last 40 years or so, but feels eternal in the way it runs its course. The rural guitars of concluding track Ã¢â‚¬ËœFilm Reel,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ for example, reverberate in what seems like forever. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more a case of hypnotism than tedium, though, and with Blamire and JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ seductive voices swooning over the top, the result is all the more hypnotic. A shame that Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake Me Down When You GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHideawayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contain quite the same allure and feel rather too single paced and restrained. Otherwise, Blood Speaks is one of 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s more entrancing records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be1d8b233a81283700c2851d90b905c8f83d4b28","amp;dn":"Smoke+Fairies+-+Blood+Speaks+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be1d8b233a81283700c2851d90b905c8f83d4b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,29,139,35,58,129,40,55,0,194,133,29,144,185,5,200,248,61,75,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
