After finishing his first record For All That ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worth, Pake and fellow songwriter Marshall Anderson got in his white van, aka Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vanna White,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and headed west. The result was empty pockets, a handful of timeless stories and most of the material for his second record, Mercy of the Mountain.\n\nBorn and raised in Hebbronville, Texas Pake is a singer/songwriter who grew up listening to and learning to appreciate traditional (good) country music. His first experience playing for the public was in church, accompanying his father (Clark) playing Bluegrass Gospel music. His music is a combination of Country, Folk and Blues, although he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like Ã¢â‚¬Å“labelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Pake has been greatly influenced by his rich south Texas heritage and you can hear this tradition in the song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CrosswindsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a ballad based on the true story of his great grandfather. Some of PakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest influences include, Rodney Crowell, Townes Van Zandt, John Prine, Todd Snyder and Houston Marchman just to name a few. Pake is currently living in San Marcos, Texas and has recently completed his debut Album Ã¢â‚¬Å“For All That ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WorthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that was release in Sept. 2010. The Album was recorded in Lytton Springs, Texas at Cowpatty Studio with friend and owner Donny Brewer. Pake has traveled the North Western US promoting the Album and continues to write and perform in and around central and south Texas.
