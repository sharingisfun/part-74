Their tactics and battles are still revered and studied by scholars and military leaders alike -- almost two thousand years later. Now, you can take up their sword.\n\nAs Alexander the Great. Take command of the legendary armies of Macedon. Conquer the rebellious Greeks. Crush the defiant Persians. Capture the crowns of kings and pharaohs to earn the most exalted title of all: Alexander the Great. Or attempt to turn the inexorable tide of Alexander's conquest. Assume the role of Darius, Mennon, Clitus, and other celebrated military commanders of the age. Then engage the forces of Alexander in ten different battles to rewrite the history books.\n\nAs the fearless, ruthless Hannibal of Carthage, you are the commander of 25,000 troops who have sworn their allegiance to you in blood. With decisive victories, you will bring the Roman Empire to its knees, and conquer what is rightfully yours.\n\nAs mighty Julius Caesar. Control of Rome and its hard-won provinces balances on the point of a spear. As Julius Caesar, you can cross the Rubicon and lead your troops to Rome and the supreme power. Or, as Pompey the Great, Marius, Sulla, or any other of their subordinates, you might just defeat mighty Caesar and reshape history. Either way, the prize of the greatest nation on Earth is yours to conquer. Or to lose. Everything is up to you and your tactical skill in this remarkable anthology of classic turn-based wargames. They rarely make strategy games like these nowadays!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\nPolice Quest 1-2-3-4\nPrince of Persia 2008\nLionheart: Legacy of the Crusade\nBeyond Divinity\nStonekeep\nDeus Ex 2: Invisible War\nDriftmoon\nSilver\nRunaway series\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\nEdna &amp; Harvey: TB + HE\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de74b253caf16cdcaa5edbe819388fa3b160d632","amp;dn":"The+Great+Battles+Collectors+Edition+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de74b253caf16cdcaa5edbe819388fa3b160d632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,116,178,83,202,241,108,220,170,94,219,232,25,56,143,163,177,96,214,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
