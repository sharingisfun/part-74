With tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, pianist Mulgrew Miller, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Al Foster also in the sextet, it is not surprising that Morgan sounds a bit inspired. The musicians all play up to their usual level, performing &quot;Caravan&quot; (which was added to the CD version) and Sonny Rollins' &quot;Sonnymoon for Two,&quot; plus a song apiece by Thelonious Monk (&quot;Reflections&quot;), Miller, Hutcherson, Henderson and Carter. Recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Old Bowl, New Grits\n02 - Reflections\n03 - Starting Over\n04 - Black Narcissus\n05 - Sonnymoon for Two\n06 - O.K.\n07 - Caravan\n\nEnjoy and share!
