The attacks are frequent and widespread, and the attackers commit the most terrible of atrocities.\nThese attackers have been dubbed the 'Evils of the Earth-depths'\nOne day, Granzalk Castle is the subject of an attack by the Evils of the Earth-depths.\n\nIn the midst of the fierce fighting, Ryle, a young apprentice swordsman whose parents were both killed in a previous attack by the Evils, and who vows revenge, finds himself in the underground chambers of the castle. In one of those chambers, he discovers a golem built to oppose the Evils.\nAnd so the quest begins: Ryle takes the fate of the kingdom on his shoulders, and, along with Denoas, the golem built to oppose the Evils, sets off first to the village of the elves...\n\nThis is KEMCO's first brand-new RPG designed from the ground up especially for smartphones!\nDon't miss the epic story that unfolds around Ryle and Denoas and the characters they encounter, each with their own intentions and motives!\n\nSmoothly Animated Dynamic Battles\nSmooth animation and dramatic voice effects bring the characters' battle scenes to life.\nThere are huge numbers of enemies trying to stop your progress. Some of them even have parts which are destroyed when they are damaged beyond a certain level. For example, an enemy might be clad in formidable armor to begin with, but if that armor is destroyed, the enemy's appearance changes and defense ability dropsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but on the other hand, the enemy's movements might become swifter.\nDon't ignore these changes- use them to alter the battle situation to your advantage!\n\nWhat's in this version:\nEnglish version is available.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kemco.wws.soo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kemco.wws.soo&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4805e1de14e10cc6d026dcb636b9b8d24bacf42","amp;dn":"RPG+Symphony+of+the+Origin+v1.0.3g","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4805e1de14e10cc6d026dcb636b9b8d24bacf42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,128,94,29,225,78,16,204,109,2,109,203,99,107,155,141,36,186,207,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
