Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missionsÃ¢â‚¬â€which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battlesÃ¢â‚¬â€in various Southeast Asian locations, even going as far as Phu Quoc island of Vietnam and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur which is often destroyed in firefights.\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nAubs: Eng\nEps: 24\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\nFormat: .mkv\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87fa1877e9adf2059d652939596bf4950842110","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DBlack+Lagoon+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87fa1877e9adf2059d652939596bf4950842110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,127,161,135,126,154,223,32,89,214,82,147,149,150,191,73,80,132,33,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
