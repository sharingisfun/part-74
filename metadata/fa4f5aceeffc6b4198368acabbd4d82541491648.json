Dalal believes in humane and roots music, which is reflected in the many different genres of music Dalal performs.\n\n \nShe mixes between Tarab (classical Arabic music) and folk, while trying to focus on different rhythms and Maqamat (the system of melodic modes used in Arabic music). Dalal and her band participate in several festivals around the world. She accompanies several international orchestras, such as MESTO Orchestra from USA and Andalusian Orchestra from Palestine. Dalal also has a special performance for children in which she teaches them Arabic classical music in a simplified way.\n\nDuration : 49:18 | Bitarte : 320 kBit/s | Year : 2012 | Full Covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4f5aceeffc6b4198368acabbd4d82541491648","amp;dn":"Dalal+Abu+Amneh+-+2012+-+About+Balady","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4f5aceeffc6b4198368acabbd4d82541491648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,79,90,206,239,252,107,65,152,54,138,202,187,212,216,37,65,73,22,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
