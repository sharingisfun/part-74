Outfit your character exactly the way you want through the\nnew and extensive customization system. Choose your own loadout of towers,\nweapons and perks, but choose wisely because you are humanity's last defense\nagainst the unrelenting hordes set out to destroy it.\n\nSanctum 2 is a new game completely rebuilt from the ground up using community\nfeedback and innovative design to really push the bar of what an independent\nstudio can do.\n\nIn Sanctum 2, you will utilize elements from multiple gameplay genres to\nsucceed. Construct towers and walls during the building phase before the\nenemies attack, then jump into the fray and blast everything to pieces in FPS\nmode. You can progress through the single-player campaign yourself, or play\nwith up to four friends in co-op to discover the secrets of the planet LOEK\nIII and learn the backstory on why the aliens are so intent on destroying the\nCores you are sworn to protect.\n\nBuilding on the success of the original game, Sanctum 2 stands alone as the\nonly true FPS/Tower Defense hybrid. No other title delivers gameplay that\nseamlessly combines both genres.\n\nFeatures\n* Tower Defense  Design complex mazes and build powerful towers to stop the\n  enemies from destroying the Cores.\n* Four playable character classes  Each with their own unique strengths,\n  weaknesses and weapons.\n* In-game Visual Novel  Unlock a comic-book page for every map you beat to\n  discover the secrets of LOEK III.\n\n\n1.
