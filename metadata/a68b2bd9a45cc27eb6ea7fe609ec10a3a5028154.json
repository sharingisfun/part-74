No Unity. No Gnome3. Just the Gnome2 fork MATE for that familiar 10.04 feel. Fans of v1.3 will appreciate the additions to this final LTS 32bit release. MATE 1.6, Linux Kernel 3.2.0-40, Xscreensaver, Caja (default), Vokoscreencaster, XBMC, Wireshark, WiFi Radar, PulseAudio EQ, Google Chrome, Skype and more. Included with this release are a number of original themes and emeralds for your enjoyment. Sockpuppet idles at 115mb RAM without compiz enabled which makes it the perfect choice for that &quot;lower spec&quot; machine. 12.04 will be supported by Ubuntu until 2017 as will sockpuppet with its Ubuntu base. Be sure to read the documentation included with the download. \n\n\n\nThe Open Linux Forum\n\n\n\n\nsockpuppet64GamersEdition due May '13.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a68b2bd9a45cc27eb6ea7fe609ec10a3a5028154","amp;dn":"sockpuppet32BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a68b2bd9a45cc27eb6ea7fe609ec10a3a5028154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,139,43,217,164,92,194,126,182,234,127,230,9,236,16,163,165,2,129,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
