Back on the beach, the raiders defeat a superior Northumbrian force under Lord Wigea sent by King Aelle, and return to Kattegat. There, Earl Haraldson has Ragnar, who claims to have killed Knut, arrested and tried at the Thing. The Earl's ploy to bribe Rollo to testify against Ragnar fails, and he is acquitted.
