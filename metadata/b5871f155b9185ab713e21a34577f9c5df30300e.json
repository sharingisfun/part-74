Learn the secrets of Tet and the Bible. Revealed to those that are willing to search.\n\n\nIn the Western world, we study the Bible in English transliterated from Greek text.If you want to get closer to God, study the Hebrew letters and find the Hebrew text and meaning of the Bible.You can use Strong's concordance(look up app) to help find Hebrew text.The &quot;Complete Jewish Bible&quot; by David H.

But El Shaddai is the best source to use.If you don't have time to watch the video- Look at all the slides and then listen to the mp3 while on the go.\n\n I am just trying to make it easier for more people to share this information. I encourage you to seed this and share with others. Support El Shaddai ministries, if you can. There are services every Saturday that are live streamed on the Web.Mondays are teaching sessions live streamed.They can later be downloaded.  \n\n\nLeave a comment if these lessons are helping anyone .I am interested\nin finding out what people are getting from these lessons.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5871f155b9185ab713e21a34577f9c5df30300e","amp;dn":"Hebrew+letters-Vol+9-Tet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5871f155b9185ab713e21a34577f9c5df30300e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,135,31,21,91,145,133,171,113,62,33,163,69,119,249,197,223,48,48,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
