In my book the original was and is much better than the remake.  The remake didn't follow the story line as I thought it should and they changed the story too much from the classic movie.  The 2008 version does have much better special effects, but after all technology has improved by leaps and bounds in 57 years. You decide for yourself which is the better movie.  \n\n\n1951 - An alien lands and tells the people of Earth that they must live peacefully or be destroyed as a danger to other planets.\n\nDirector: Robert Wise\n\nStars: Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe\n\n\n2008 -  A remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi film about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth.\n\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\n\nStars: Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccab7cebaaebd993fa323707c68ef873f867948","amp;dn":"The+Day+the+Earth+Stood+Still+1951+%26amp%3B+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccab7cebaaebd993fa323707c68ef873f867948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,202,183,206,186,174,189,153,63,163,35,112,124,104,239,135,63,134,121,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
