B.C. renegades race down mountain highways on customized longboards, while a middle-aged skateboarder fights to keep his Ottawa skate park and creaky knees operational. Whether it's bombing down hills at over 100km per hour, just inches from the ground, or spending 25 years and their life savings to keep competing in the sport they love, these guys are truly devoted - and a little road rash or even open-heart surgery are simply tests for the faithful. What starts out as a gonzo skate movie turns into a surprisingly heartfelt documentary that bears witness to the power of community, dedication and the DIY spirit. With intimate and candid moments that may lead you to think this is a mocumentary, Highway Gospel is a humorous and at times heartbreaking multi-character documentary that strikes an intricate balance between rowdy and insightful while serving as a reminder that heartfelt stories can also be hilarious. \n\nStarring: Jody &quot;Schnitzel&quot; Willcox, Noah Weshe\nDirected by: Jaret Belliveau, Craig Jackson\nRuntime: 1 hour 32 minutes\nStudio: Gravitas Ventures\n\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 673 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 027 Kbps\n\nVideo\nDuration                                 : 1h 31mn\nBit rate                                 : 895 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 704 pixels\nHeight                                   : 396 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 24.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nStream size                              : 586 MiB (87%)\nLanguage                                 : English\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : AAC\nDuration                                 : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 83.7 MiB (12%)\nLanguage                                 : English\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdad6d440095afc6b0388f534d413cf0592943d7","amp;dn":"Highway+Gospel+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdad6d440095afc6b0388f534d413cf0592943d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,173,109,68,0,149,175,198,176,56,143,83,77,65,60,240,89,41,67,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
