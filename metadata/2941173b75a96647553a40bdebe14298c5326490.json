Led by the charming frontline of crooner/rhythm guitarist Doug Sammons and ukelele-strumming chanteuse Dee Settlemier, the Serenaders' repertoire consists of specially chosen gems from the past, as well as vintage sounding original songs. The Midnight Serenaders are based in Portland, Oregon and perform at clubs and events throughout the Pacific Northwest, continuing to delight audiences with their brand of hot retro swing.\n\n2007 - Magnolia FLAC\nTrack list:\n01.
