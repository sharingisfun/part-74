I never could seem to get to the VCR in time to record any of the episodes (I told you it was awhile ago...), so I've made my own. And here it is.\n\nAll of these clips were ripped from Youtube. This means that:\n1. The quality is a bit dicey (some O.K., some not so much), and\n2. Since all these videos are already all available to freely view, I'm hoping to not fall afoul of the Intellectual Property police (cf. track 1 - &quot;Don't Download This Song&quot;)\n\nThis collection isn't complete, or even comprehensive. Just most of my and my friends' favorites. The .iso is ready to burn to DVD. Enjoy at your own risk.\n\nTrack list\n1. Don't Download This Song\n2. My Sharona / My Bologna\n3.
