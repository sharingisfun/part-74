Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn Your Feet or on Your Knees is Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's first live album, released in early 1975. Each of the band's first three studio albums is represented by three songs each, two other songs are covers (&quot;I Ain't Got You&quot;, albeit with modified lyrics, and &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;), and one (&quot;Buck's Boogie&quot;) is an original instrumental that remains a staple of the band's live shows to this day. The 12 songs include performances at the Academy of Music in New York City, the Paramount Theatre in Portland, the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, the Show Palace in Phoenix, the Long Beach Arena, the P.N.E. Coliseum in Vancouver and the Capitol Theatre in New Jersey, though it is not clear which songs came from which venues and on what dates.\n\nIt hit No. 22 on the Billboard 200, thus making it the band's highest charting album in the U.S.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0fab9d94ab7740abb30d38be386637298c088e","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+On+Your+Feet+Or+On+Your...%5BLive%5D%5B1975%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0fab9d94ab7740abb30d38be386637298c088e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,15,171,157,148,171,119,64,171,179,13,56,190,56,102,55,41,140,8,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
