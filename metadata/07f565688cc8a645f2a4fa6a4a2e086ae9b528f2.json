It was released first in the UK and was later released in the U.S. with different album artwork. Because this single is the first from their debut LP &quot;Is This It&quot;,  &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; made the anticipation for the album proper very high, and when &quot;Is This It&quot; did come out it was widely hailed as one of the best of the year. The single reached #16 on the singles chart in the UK. The single was voted #3 on the NME Top 100 songs of the decade. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 36 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;.\n    The music video for this song was rarely broadcast on television because it did not contain enough shots of the band members, but was instead a montage of random stock footage shots of things that could be considered &quot;hard to explain&quot;. Footage of The Strokes playing &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; from MTV2's Two Dollar Bill concert is used in the video. Amongst stock footage, the video contains clips from Magnum, P.I. and Knight Rider (both of which are credited), a clip from the film Brainstorm, a commercial for the 1970 Dodge Charger 500 (scene of a woman sitting in a car), a clip from the film WarGames, NASA footage of the Space Shuttle Atlantis in orbit, the rocket engine firing of the Saturn V and image of particle tracks in a bubble chamber (which forms the album cover for 'Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is This It'). Some of the stock footage was taken from the film &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, which was presented by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n\n    &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; is a 7&quot; single by the American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It is the third single from their album &quot;Elephant&quot;. The music video utilizes pixilation animation to create the effect of dozens of drum kits and guitar amplifiers multiplying to the rhythm of the song as Jack and Meg perform. For example, in one sequence, Meg is seen playing the bass drum at a PATH train station. On every beat, a new drum materializes just ahead of her and she instantly appears behind it to play that beat, leaving all the previous drums vacant. This effect was achieved by first setting up a trail of bass drums. Then, Meg would be filmed performing a single beat on the last drum in the line, which would then be removed; she would move back one drum, play another beat, and so on. The final video is edited to include the drum beats with the sequence reversed, making it appear as if the drums are being added to the beat, appearing out of thin air. Gondry used 32 identical Ludwig drum kits, 32 identical amplifiers, and 16 identical microphone stands during the shoot. The drum kits were donated to a music school after the shoot. Much of the video was filmed around Riverside Drive and the Columbia University area near Grant's Tomb and around the 125th Street exit and surrounding neighborhood, all part of the Upper West Side in Manhattan, New York City. Parts of the video were filmed at the 33rd Street PATH station.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f565688cc8a645f2a4fa6a4a2e086ae9b528f2","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+480","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f565688cc8a645f2a4fa6a4a2e086ae9b528f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,245,101,104,140,200,166,69,242,164,250,106,74,46,8,106,233,181,40,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
