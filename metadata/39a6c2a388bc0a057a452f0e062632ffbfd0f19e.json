The murderer: Lucas Kane. The smouldering detective: Carla Valenti. The NYPD Agent: Tyler Miles. And the murderer's brother and priest: Markus Kane.\n\nDiscover the truth: Why are these victims being killed? What is making people engage in these murders? And who is the mastermind behind it all? This is a unique chance to run from the police and hide from yourself. Welcome to a new form of video game.\n\nFahrenheit is a second game made by Quantic Dream - studio responsible for masterpieces such as Omikron: The Nomad Soul and Heavy Rain.
