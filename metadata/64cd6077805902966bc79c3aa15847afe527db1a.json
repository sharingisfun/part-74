The Lamed represents control/authority. The number value of Lamed is 30. Joseph came into his authority in Egypt at 30, David at 30, Yeshua(Jesus) at around 30. The first letter of the Hebrew word for tongue is the Lamed. The control or authority. Life and Death are in the power(control) of the tongue.\n\n\nIn the Western world, we study the Bible in English transliterated from Greek text.If you want to get closer to God, study the Hebrew letters and find the Hebrew text and meaning of the Bible.You can use Strong's concordance(look up app) to help find Hebrew text.The &quot;Complete Jewish Bible&quot; by David H. Stern is another great source.

But El Shaddai is the best source to use.If you don't have time to watch the video- Look at all the slides and then listen to the mp3 while on the go.\n\n I am trying to make it easier for more people to share this information. I encourage you to seed this and share with others. Support El Shaddai ministries, if you can.
