So that's what we did.&quot;\n\n&quot;There ain't no way to know/ How life will change you so,&quot; they sing. &quot;Let's rock &amp; roll as we get old/ We will before too long.&quot; The stalwart, self-aware Memphis trio delivers the message in the familiar punk-rock-blues style of their previous albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including their last, 1997's Play Nine Songs With Mr. Quintron. The album was engineered by Collin Dupuis at Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound in Nashville.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e889b21a91083b1b39fae03c19db354e5094b6","amp;dn":"The+Oblivians+-+Desperation+%282013%29+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e889b21a91083b1b39fae03c19db354e5094b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,232,137,178,26,145,8,59,27,57,250,224,60,25,219,53,78,80,148,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
