In this sly companion piece to Yojimbo, the jaded samurai Sanjuro helps an idealistic group of young warriors weed out their clan's evil influences, and in the process turns their image of a &quot;proper&quot; samurai on its ear. Less brazen in tone than its predecessor but equally entertaining, this classic character's return is a masterpiece in its own right. Criterion is proud to present this Kurosawa favorite in a new, an anamorphic high-definition transfer.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio commentary by film historian and Akira Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince\nA 35-minute documentary on the making of Sanjuro, created as part of the Toho Masterworks series Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create\nTheatrical trailer and teaser\nStills gallery of behind-the-scenes photos\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
