Brought to you by the exciting team of Duane Swierczynski and Eric Nguyen, X has a wide reach of appeal for fans who love a nouveau pulp yarn mixed with bloody, bare knuckle action in a seedy city whose underbelly is a place of enjoyment for the reader.\n\nAfter killing Leo Pietrain, a man thought unkillable due to his well designed Ã¢â‚¬Å“panic roomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, X is on the lookout for his next target. But when the police spring a trap for him, his life may be in the hands of a young woman, a former journalist, on the trail of the one man who caused so much bloody death at a local warehouse. Will X retain his secret identity, or will Leigh Ferguson get her muckraking news story for her web blog?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd1ae0b326950cc23ab4968f24eccfbe2efdd13","amp;dn":"X+001+%282013%29+%28Dark+Horse%29+%28digital%29+%28Son+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd1ae0b326950cc23ab4968f24eccfbe2efdd13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,209,174,11,50,105,80,204,35,171,73,104,242,78,204,251,226,239,221,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
