My thanks to SoundbaronPirateBay for his lossless upload.\n\nThis is in OGG VBR q9. The average bitrate is 304kbps, though it should sound of a better quality than that of an MP3 at 320kbps in CBR. I've got the album tagged, and provided a 1000x1000 JPG from a higher-res PNG on the web.\n\nGreat album by the way. It's from the time when The Antlers was only Peter Silberman. Have fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b30ed60fef3533b91c9e4757e4e27fe932642e","amp;dn":"The+Antlers+-+In+the+Attic+of+the+Universe+%282007%29+%5BOGG+q9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b30ed60fef3533b91c9e4757e4e27fe932642e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,179,14,214,15,239,53,51,185,28,158,71,87,228,226,127,233,50,100,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
