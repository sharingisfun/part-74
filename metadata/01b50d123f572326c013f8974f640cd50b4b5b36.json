This program on flying WAAS approaches with the Garmin 430W/530W gives pilots the knowledge needed to fly these new instrument approaches with confidence. In this program, weÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll examine the redesigned RNAV (GPS) approach charts. You will learn the specifics of LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches and see how they provide ILS-like guidance when using the Garmin 430W, one of the most popular panel-mount units. YouÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll ride along on three flights to see, step-by-step, how to set-up and fly three different GPS approaches including an LPV approach. Learn how the unit provides turn-by-turn guidance for flying procedure turns and holding patterns and how the 430W uses WAAS information to provide an electronic glidepath and more accurate navigation guidance. \n\nApprox. 20 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b50d123f572326c013f8974f640cd50b4b5b36","amp;dn":"Sportys+WAAS+Approaches%3A+Garmin+430W%2F530W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b50d123f572326c013f8974f640cd50b4b5b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,181,13,18,63,87,35,38,192,19,248,151,79,100,12,213,11,75,91,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
