Tenth grader Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is Rushmore Academy's most extracurricular student-and its least scholarly. He faces expulsion and enters into unlikely friendships with both a lovely first-grade teacher (Olivia Williams) and a melancholy self-made millionaire (Bill Murray). Set to a soundtrack of classic British Invasion tunes, Rushmore defies categorization even as it captures the pain and exuberance of adolescence with wit, emotional depth, and cinematic panache.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio Commentary by Wes Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and actor Jason Schwartzman\nMaking of Rushmore: an exclusive behind the scenes documentary by Eric Chase Anderson\nMax Fischer players present theatrical adaptations of Armageddon, Out Of Sight, and The Truman Show, staged especially for the 1999 MTV Movie Awards\nThe Charlie Rose show, featuring Wes Anderson and Bill Murray\nCast Audition Footage\nWes Anderson's hand-drawn storyboards, plus a film-to storyboard comparison\nProps, posters, photos, and other graphic ephemera\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
