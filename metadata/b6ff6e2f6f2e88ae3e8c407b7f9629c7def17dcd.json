Best Magic App EVER!&quot; - Marc Spelmann\n_________________________________________\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing quite like seeing the look on peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faces when you perform something AMAZING.\n\nThen, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that cute girl or guy that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been trying to meet. With iForce, you've got the perfect way to break the ice and get their attention.\n\nImagine . . .\nYou ask her to think of her favorite type of food . . . sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking Sushi (Remember sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only THINKING Sushi!)\nAfter a deep look into her eyes, you doodle what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking on the phone display, and leave it face down on the table.\nThe moment she whispers her favorite food, you smile triumphantly. The phone is flipped over and her jaw drops when she sees that you had correctly predicted Ã¢â‚¬Å“SUSHIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ !!\n\nThis is just one example of the infinite mentalism effects that you will do.\n\niForce is a revolutionary performance tool for dazzling friends, colleagues and even clients. Capture attention or draw a crowd at parties, events or trade shows. Everyone will want to know, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HOW did you do that?!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nYou'll read minds . . . predict the future . . . and even engage in a little MIND CONTROL! There's nothing shady or harmful; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all magic . . . fun and absolutely astonishing.\n\nPart of the illusion is the app itself. Disguised as a simple Ã¢â‚¬Å“DoodleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ program, iForce is lurking inside, unseen and undetectable. Everything is examinable, which adds to the mystery.\n\niForce is the ONLY product that lets you create on-the-spot custom tricks that you perform instantly.
