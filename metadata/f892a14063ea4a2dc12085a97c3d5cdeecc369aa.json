Both nothing and everything in this unconventional documentary directed by Erroll Morris. Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control (Referring to the robot specialist's strange philosophy of robot design structure, not Erroll Morris's documentary techniques!) interplays, overlaps, and interrelates these four separate and highly specialized documentary subjects in order to in truth study all of humanity, raising questions about the future of mankind.\n\n\nNOTES:\nI haven't found this documentary anywhere on the web. This should be shared for the unfortunate people, who could otherwise never get their hands on this. \n\n\n=============================================================\nPlease buy the DVD and support the work if you can afford it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f892a14063ea4a2dc12085a97c3d5cdeecc369aa","amp;dn":"Fast%2C+Cheap+%26amp%3B+Out+of+Control+%281997%2C+Errol+Morris%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f892a14063ea4a2dc12085a97c3d5cdeecc369aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,146,161,64,99,234,74,45,193,32,133,169,124,61,92,222,236,195,105,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
