But years earlier he used to work for the Section, an undercover part of the Ministry of Defence, and was involved in an assassination attempt on a rising black politician. An attempt is made on Harry's life, after one of his old army colleagues turns up on his doorstep - is this coincidence, or is Kabinda bent on revenge? Or is the Section up to its dirty tricks?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5812a167e7220c48308e198567e43036c84a3b3","amp;dn":"Deadfall+-+BBC+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5812a167e7220c48308e198567e43036c84a3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,129,42,22,126,114,32,196,131,8,225,152,86,126,67,3,108,132,163,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
