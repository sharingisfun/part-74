Louis is brought up in genteel poverty, but decides to take his revenge by killing off all the members of the D Ascoigne family. Perhaps one day, he could become Duke of Chalfont.....??\n\nA darkly comic tale, but one which was best served by the original film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7265dd4548d6089cf083471d7417e679d9f03bb8","amp;dn":"Kind+Hearts+%26amp%3B+Coronets+-+1996.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7265dd4548d6089cf083471d7417e679d9f03bb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,101,221,69,72,214,8,156,240,131,71,29,116,23,230,121,217,240,59,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
