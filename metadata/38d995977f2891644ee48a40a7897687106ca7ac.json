Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger, the mine owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners.\n\nA year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murder rampage. Soon after, Sherrif Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies and the heart of a nurse inside the candy box. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mineshaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially relucant to go to the mine party, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before departing inside.\n\nDVD: 9 COPIA 1:1\nLanguage: ENG - ITA\nSub: ITA\nMenu: SI\nExtra: SI\n\n\nUse NERO to burn .iso, burn to DVD a low speed for best results, or use DEAMON TOOLS to mount .iso ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d995977f2891644ee48a40a7897687106ca7ac","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine+DVD9+Eng+Ita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d995977f2891644ee48a40a7897687106ca7ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,217,149,151,127,40,145,100,78,228,138,64,167,137,118,135,16,108,167,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
