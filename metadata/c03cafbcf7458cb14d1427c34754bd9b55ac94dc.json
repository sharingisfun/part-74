Having carved out a niche on the increasingly crowded dancefloor amongst a gaggle of similarly inclined acts like Ellie Goulding, La Roux, Robyn, and Lady Gaga with such cuts as &quot;Stuck on Repeat,&quot; and &quot;Earthquake,&quot; Victoria Hesketh aka Little Boots has found a more personal niche within the genre on Nocturnes. Subsequently, though still an infectious listen, Nocturnes is a surprisingly low-key affair. Tracks like &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Motorway,&quot; in which Little Boots fantasizes about jumping in her car and getting away from her troubles in a kind of road-trip catharsis, have an expansive, ambient quality that seems to reflect a more introspective mood. \n\n  In &quot;Motorway&quot; she sings &quot;Getting late, coffee's cold/Heavy eyes on the road/We won't stop, no we won't break/Shadows high overtake/The small town we left behind/It's not even on my mind.&quot; These kind of ruminative, evocative lyrics permeate the record, lending it a more subdued feel than one might expect from Little Boots' previous dance-heavy singles. However, there are still enough vintage-influenced dance sounds and winky, glitter-mascara moments to appeal to even the most camp-oriented club kid. To these ends, the house-influenced &quot;Every Night I Say a Prayer&quot; brings to mind Blonde Ambition Tour-era Madonna, and &quot;Broken Record,&quot; with its pulsing Italo-disco beat and church bell accents, sounds like an ABBA club hit produced by Giorgio Moroder. Ultimately, if Hands was Little Boots' booty-shaking call to the dancefloor, then Nocturnes is the afterglow, post-party soundtrack for the ride home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03cafbcf7458cb14d1427c34754bd9b55ac94dc","amp;dn":"Little+Boots+-+Nocturnes+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03cafbcf7458cb14d1427c34754bd9b55ac94dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,60,175,188,247,69,140,177,77,20,39,195,71,84,189,155,85,172,148,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
