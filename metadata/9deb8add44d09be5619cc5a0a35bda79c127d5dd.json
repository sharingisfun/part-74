While Johnston was already a well-known West Coast session player, Melcher (the son of Doris Day) had released a series of singles under the name Terry Day before being named Columbia Records' youngest-ever staff producer; he brought Johnston to the company to release 1963's Surfin' Round the World, and the pair soon began collaborating regularly. As the Rip Chords, they scored their biggest hit with 1964's &quot;Hey Little Cobra; &quot; a series of singles credited to Bruce and Terry followed before the duo went their separate ways, with Johnston joining the Beach Boys and Melcher enjoying even greater success as a producer. In mid-1998 the Sundazed label compiled The Best of Bruce and Terry, a 20-track collection of their hits.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bruce--terry-p184711&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bruce--terry-p184711&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Cub Koda):\n\nThis 20-track compilation gathers together the best of Johnston's and Melcher's best sides for Columbia under the B&amp;T moniker. That's important, because this collection could just as easily have been double the length if they had amassed all the tracks that Bruce &amp; Terry had recorded under other names like the Rip Chords, etc. including the hit &quot;Hey Little Cobra.&quot; Because Bruce &amp; Terry were a virtual vocal overdubbing machine, some of the tracks on here (&quot;Custom Machine,&quot; &quot;Don't Run Away,&quot; &quot;I Love You Model T,&quot; &quot;Come Love,&quot; &quot;Raining In My Heart&quot;) appear in mono-only formats. This becomes the only way to hear the final product as it was etched into black phonograph records, as B&amp;T would overdub right directly onto the final single track mix. It also gives the sound of these tracks an edgy, mid-rangey &quot;squashed&quot; kind of compression to them, making them leap out of the speakers. As a musical satellite orbiting around the Brian Wilson/Jan &amp; Dean/Wrecking Crew axis, the music here reflects that time and sound beautifully. These are the beginnings of two long-standing careers in the record business and the records they literally cut their teeth on.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-bruce--terry-r366729&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-bruce--terry-r366729&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000009QRW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000009QRW&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
