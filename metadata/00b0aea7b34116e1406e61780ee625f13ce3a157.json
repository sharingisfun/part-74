Ruia\nStars: Swati Aggarwal, Juhi Chawla, Rajneesh Duggal \n\nPlot: the film is about an epileptic orphan Krishna whom his namesake God befriends. And then adventure follows. Staying in an orphanage run by a kind-hearted woman (Juhi Chawla), the protagonist couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have asked for more. Due to his association with Lord Krishna, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now able to pull off unimaginable things. However, the storyline is clichÃƒÂ©d thanks to sloppy screenplay and has very few memorable moments to count for. Oh yes, there are cameos by Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif too!\n\nPerhaps the target audiences are children who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind a movie where a mortal and his favourite blue-coloured God meet. If you exclude the animation part, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a no-brainer. Even the animation appears basic.\n\nNamit Shah is efficient but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearly not a child prodigy. Juhi is impeccable in her portrayal of a guardian who cares for her kids. Rajneesh Duggal shows up in a filmi dahi-handi song.\nSCREEN SHOTS[/B]\n\n\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/96382935416057052366.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/06251767199486765909.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/77791377007176619097.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/50217367485687235603.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/67478212890528285235.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/27946733885245247041.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/78411659450418447065.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/18386995622930859555.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/25471134689617058348.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/26874487373103897306.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/27829288594731750661.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img405/4108/pleaseseedy.gif[/img][/CENTER]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b0aea7b34116e1406e61780ee625f13ce3a157","amp;dn":"Main+Krishna+Hoon+%282013%29+Untouched+DVD9+-+NTSC+-+Subs+-+Team+IcT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b0aea7b34116e1406e61780ee625f13ce3a157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,176,174,167,179,65,22,225,64,110,97,120,14,230,37,241,60,227,161,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
