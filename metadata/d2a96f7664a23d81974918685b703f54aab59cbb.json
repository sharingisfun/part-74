It is composed predominantly of free and open source software, and supports community involvement.\n\nThe design approach of the development team focuses on simplicity from a developer's standpoint rather than a user's standpoint, elegance, code correctness, and minimalism. A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.\n\nArch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up to date snapshots of the main system components.\n---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a96f7664a23d81974918685b703f54aab59cbb","amp;dn":"archlinux-2013.03.01-dual.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a96f7664a23d81974918685b703f54aab59cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,169,111,118,100,162,61,129,151,73,24,104,91,112,63,84,170,181,156,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
