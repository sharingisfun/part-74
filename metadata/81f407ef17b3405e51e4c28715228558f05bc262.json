In time, the chance of a new life becomes non-existent; her life is going nowhere. Meeting a young man, she then finds a plane ticket in her hand and a new life in Sweden: a job, an apartment and prospects. All is not what it seems. There shall be work, there shall be housing and there shall be no escape. This is the stark, frank and disturbing vision of the life of a young victim of the underground sex trade and in all its tone of realism of abject poverty, despicable actions and of wanting to show that dreaming of a better life is not a crime but that life can shatter the illusion of a happy ending.\n\nLanguages: Russian / Swedish / English / Polish\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f407ef17b3405e51e4c28715228558f05bc262","amp;dn":"Lilya+4+Ever+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f407ef17b3405e51e4c28715228558f05bc262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,244,7,239,23,179,64,94,81,228,194,135,21,34,133,88,240,91,194,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
