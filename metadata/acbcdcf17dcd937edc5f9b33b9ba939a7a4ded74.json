Reporters included veteran radio announcers Dick Joy and Harlow Wilcox. The first telecast took place on February 1, 1953 and featured a re-enactment of the Hindenburg disaster. The final telecast took place on October 13, 1957.\nOriginally telecast live, most of the later episodes were produced on film. One of the episodes, for instance, features actor Pat Conway as James J. Corbett, the boxer who fought champion John L. Sullivan in 1892.\n\nThe series also featured various key events in American and World history, portrayed in dramatic recreations. Additionally, CBS News reporters, in modern-day suits, would report on the action and interview the protagonists of each of the historical episodes. Each episode would begin with the characters setting the scene. Cronkite, from his anchor desk in New York, would give a few words on what was about to happen. An announcer would then give the date and the event, followed by a loud and boldly spoken &quot;You Are There!&quot;\n\nAt the end of the program, after Cronkite summarizes what happened in the preceding event, he reminded viewers, &quot;What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times... all things are as they were then, and you were there.&quot;\n\n\n1 - Hitler Invades Poland\n2 - Pearl Harbor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acbcdcf17dcd937edc5f9b33b9ba939a7a4ded74","amp;dn":"Walter+Cronkite+-+You+Are+There+-+WWII+Begins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acbcdcf17dcd937edc5f9b33b9ba939a7a4ded74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,188,220,241,125,205,147,126,220,95,155,51,185,186,147,154,122,77,237,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
