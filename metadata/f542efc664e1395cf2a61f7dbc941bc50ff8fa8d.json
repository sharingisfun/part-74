Thus, the Celtic side of her music is emphasized in the inclusion of Scottish and Irish traditional songs like the title track, &quot;The Star of the County Down,&quot; and &quot;On a Bright May Morning.&quot; The last song prominently features her harp, as does the instrumental &quot;Brian Boru's March,&quot; and she is accompanied by her usual backup musicians, including Ben Grossman (hurdy-gurdy), Brian Hughes (guitar), Caroline LaVelle (cello), and Hugh Marsh (violin). The chief attraction continues to be her haunting voice, which she employs to ethereal effect much of the time, although &quot;The Star of the County Down&quot; finds her taking a livelier, more direct approach, while in &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; her vocal is not so much ethereal as eerie. For many of McKennitt's fans, this will be an album they have been waiting to hear for a long time. For others, it may be a change of pace in which an artist reveals the sources of her individual style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f542efc664e1395cf2a61f7dbc941bc50ff8fa8d","amp;dn":"Loreena+McKennitt+-+The+Wind+That+Shakes+the+Barley+%5B2010%5D+%5BAlbu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f542efc664e1395cf2a61f7dbc941bc50ff8fa8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,66,239,198,100,225,57,92,242,166,31,125,188,148,27,197,15,248,250,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
