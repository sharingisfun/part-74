Jack Cole. Twenty years ago they were good buddies but horrors have changed them both. Lindsay lost her entire family except for her niece in a car accident, and Jack was held captive in New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underbelly for nearly two years by demented sub-humans. It was a soul-sucking experience thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left him a shell of a man. He refuses to descend into that hell again, especially for a girl whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably dead anyway. But when Lindsay is nearly killed there after going it alone, Jack feels compelled to save her skin. Jack navigates Lindsay through a strange territory, populated with the eccentric, the insane and the desperate. Each encounter takes them closer to LindsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s niece but also closer into the clutches of the mad creatures that will enslave them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b12cec708a72d695c149c12a769d054f0436d3","amp;dn":"Undertow+-+S.M.+Stelmack.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b12cec708a72d695c149c12a769d054f0436d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,177,44,236,112,138,114,214,149,193,73,193,42,118,157,5,79,4,54,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
