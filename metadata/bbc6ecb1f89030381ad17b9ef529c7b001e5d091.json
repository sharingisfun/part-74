Featuring guest performances by the Mavericks' Raul Malo, Bela Fleck, Vince Gill, Kim Richey, and Billy Joe Walker Jr. among others, the album tries to do too many thing, but it does enough of them well enough to make it an entertaining listen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbc6ecb1f89030381ad17b9ef529c7b001e5d091","amp;dn":"Rodney+Crowell+-+Jewel+of+the+South+%5B1995%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbc6ecb1f89030381ad17b9ef529c7b001e5d091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,198,236,177,248,144,48,56,26,209,123,158,245,41,199,176,1,229,208,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
