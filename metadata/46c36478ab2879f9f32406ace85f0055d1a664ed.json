Get ready for Hackoween!\n\nSee! Cassie and Vlad's rampage through Solar City!\n\nTremble! As alien sex gods rip the universe in half!\n\nBuy! Into our shameless hyperbole!\n\nAnd it's all for free! The only cost will be your immortal soul!\n\nA bit about Halloween Man:\nHalloween Man is the story of a goodhearted but flesh eating ghoul who inhabits a retro-futuristic Texas city. Solar City is filled with superheroes, robots, and all manner of sci/fi stuff. But it also has an increasingly large problem with ghouls and goblins. So our hero hunts them down and mashes monsters into paste.\n\nThe central figure is Solomon Hitch, the titular Halloween Man. He's sensitive young man who as at heart a romantic. He's also a cannibalistic monster. Is he a hero or a monster? Noone is quite sure and the people living in Solar City are scared to death of him. Possibly with good reason.\n\nDr. Lucy Chaplin is the female lead. Basically picture Reed Richard's brain in Marilyn Monroe's body. She is the brainy beauty to Solomon's beast. (Halloween Man is above all...a love story.) She is what inspires Solomon to heroics and keeps him grounded in humanity. The fact that she is also one of the smartest people in the world doesn't hurt.\n\nRounding out the cast is a gang of weirdos and misfits. Including a foul mouthed wizard, a talking goat, and *gasp* a normal human.\n\nThe cover is a tribute to the classic Freddy vs. Jason poster.\n\nThanks goes to the original scanner for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c36478ab2879f9f32406ace85f0055d1a664ed","amp;dn":"Hack-Slash+Hackoween+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c36478ab2879f9f32406ace85f0055d1a664ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,195,100,120,171,40,121,249,243,36,6,172,232,95,0,85,209,166,100,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
