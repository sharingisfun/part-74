Working with famed producer Billy Sherrill, who also produced the records of Tammy Wynette, the young girl with the voice mature beyond her years thus began her long career in country music. Her first released single from the album was the title song, Delta Dawn, which reached no.6 on the Billboard Country Singles charts in April 1972. The other two charting singles both did slightly better: Love's the Answer and The Jamestown Ferry both rose to no.5. The album itself was at no.32 on the Country Albums chart.
