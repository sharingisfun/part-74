The idea behind the battery-powered card is its patented design allows owners to register their credit accounts with companies like Dark Horse to earn rewards. The system is much like a credit card earning airline miles, however the technology means users can decide which of their purchases will specifically apply to a range of companies offering rewards.\n\nAhead of its launch, the ePlate card has already signed on for rewards programs with geek-friendly companies like Upper Deck trading cards and Evil Genius Games, and in the case of the Dark Horse program, purchases made on the ePlate card will earn users pages of these new comics. Once a card owner has gained the full amount of story pages, they'll receive access to the full digital comic in the Dark Horse app and eventually a free print edition as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735df7a36a35293a22f7a3d5b59e41f19979fab5","amp;dn":"TWO+PAST+MIDNIGHT+001-003+%282013%29+%28Dark+Horse%29+%28digital%29+%28Son+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735df7a36a35293a22f7a3d5b59e41f19979fab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,93,247,163,106,53,41,58,34,247,163,213,181,158,65,241,153,121,250,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
