Pundit Glenn Beck has gone so far as to use the title of Tom PaineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous 1776 pamphlet Common Sense for his own bookÃ¢â‚¬â€a book that attacks the political, social and economic rights which Paine and the Founders fought for.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to cut through the rhetoric, smoke, and spin, and get back to our core American values. We have gone off course as a country by emphasizing consumerism over citizenship, entertainment over education, and &quot;me&quot; over &quot;we.&quot; By rediscovering the moral compass our Founders put into place, we can create a united America, and a future worthy of our grandchildren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fcbaf980d2ab827ad3f841a2e9f63614e6185e","amp;dn":"Real+Common+Sense","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96fcbaf980d2ab827ad3f841a2e9f63614e6185e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,252,186,249,128,210,171,130,122,211,248,65,162,233,246,54,20,230,24,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
