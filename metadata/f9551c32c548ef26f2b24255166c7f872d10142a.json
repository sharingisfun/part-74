He picked the name because his cape looks like a pair of insect wings. He had no superpowers.\n\n\nNotes \n    Wasp is often confused with the Hooded Wasp, a character published by Street and Smith ( Hooded Wasp is NOT public domain). The Hooded Wasp had a sidekick named Wasplet and made a buzzing sound before he attacked. Wasp does not share any of these features. \n\n    Harvey Comics later created their own Wasp character in 1940 who was very similar to the Lev Gleason version. \n\nHarvey's wasp:\n\nNewspaper editor Dan Burton was the masked detective known as the Wasp. He devoted his life to fighting crime. He had no powers, instead relying on his wits and fighting skills to bring in criminals, and he made a buzzing sound before he attacked. Only his pal Blackie knew his secret identity.\n\n\nseed for all to enjoy                 sharing is caring\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9551c32c548ef26f2b24255166c7f872d10142a","amp;dn":"The+Wasp+Lev+Gleason+and+Harvey++1939-1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9551c32c548ef26f2b24255166c7f872d10142a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,85,28,50,197,72,239,38,242,178,66,85,22,108,127,135,45,16,20,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
