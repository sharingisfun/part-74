With his brother Gary(Rob Corddry) who is behind the controls guiding him on the missions, Gary is not a thrill seeker like his brother, they are from the planet BAAB. Scorch gets a new mission, to go the forbidden planet AKA Earth. Gary refuses to go along with it. Cause he is tired of being in his brothers shadow. When Scorch gets captured when he does arrive on earth, it's up to Gary to rescue him, but will he?\n\nThe animation is almost up there with Wreck It Ralph. The jokes seem run themselves into the ground. Most of the time instead of trying to have a story, I feel it was going more for satire. Not that it was terrible, but not has good as Monters Vs Aliens(2009). Brendan Fraser and Rob Corddry are alright in voice casting.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96ccf52c7c525603ff06ac30ec806f8acc08d945","amp;dn":"Escape.From.Planet.Earth.2013.RETAIL.BDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-AXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96ccf52c7c525603ff06ac30ec806f8acc08d945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,204,245,44,124,82,86,3,255,6,172,48,236,128,111,138,204,8,217,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
