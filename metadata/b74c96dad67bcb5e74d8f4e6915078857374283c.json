Now he has been forced out by protests against his authoritarian regime, the White House's efforts may come to naught.\n \nAmerica's Dangerous Game, from filmmakers Richard Rowley and Jeremy Scahill, reveals the full scale of the covert war in Yemen and asks the question: Is the US creating more enemies than it can kill or capture?\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dirty Wars- The World BattlefieldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Jeremy Scahill has just been published. A movie version will be released soon.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/22836/Dirty-W...ll--pdf-and--epub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/22836/Dirty-W...ll--pdf-and--epub&lt;/a&gt; OR http://www.amazon.com/Dirty-Wars-The-World-Batt...eld/dp/156858671X\n\nshunster\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74c96dad67bcb5e74d8f4e6915078857374283c","amp;dn":"America%27s+Dangerous+Game++Aljazeera++2013+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74c96dad67bcb5e74d8f4e6915078857374283c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,76,150,218,214,123,203,94,116,216,244,230,145,80,120,133,115,116,40,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
