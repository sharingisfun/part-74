In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, Jones passionately argues against foreign entanglements and wars for the sake of corporate and banking interests. Jones avoids the bogus political labels of Ã¢â‚¬Å“left and rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and instead focuses on what really matters Ã¢â‚¬â€ whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right and wrong.\n\n\n\nMy Blog: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6341a1da3b6d1c638a2686baf050bed32f24be","amp;dn":"InfoWars+Magazine+-+April+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6341a1da3b6d1c638a2686baf050bed32f24be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,99,65,161,218,59,109,28,99,138,38,134,186,240,80,190,211,47,36,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
