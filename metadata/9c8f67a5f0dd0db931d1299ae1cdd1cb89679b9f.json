Produced by LWT and directed by Stuart Allen, it was set in a language school in London, with Barry Evans (June 18, 1943 - February 11, 1997) as the embattled night school English language teacher for a motley crew of assorted foreigners.\n\nThe series was known for its crude representation of national stereotypes:\n\nThe German woman was dour and humourless; the French woman was sexy and flirtatious; the Swedish woman was liberated and straightforwardly sex-mad; the Chinese woman a rampant Maoist; while the Sikh and Pakistani men were often on the brink of war, and the Spaniard, the Greek and the Italian were macho.\n\nMuch of the humour also stemmed from the trouble the students had with the English language, their contrived speech patterns and the students' bizarre mispronunciations of English.\n\nMore recently the show was criticised for unimaginative racism, but in its day the show was popular with people of many backgrounds because of its light-hearted take on multiculturalism and because it gave some otherwise unrepresented minorities a television presence, albeit represented as caricatures.\n\nThe show was cancelled in 1979 by Michael Grade, then LWT's Deputy Controller of Entertainment, who considered the stereotyping offensive. Nevertheless it was sold to other countries where it found amazing popularity, including Pakistan, Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia and Singapore.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cnTxd7E.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cnTxd7E.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z0PyZmQ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z0PyZmQ.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AVbVIns.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AVbVIns.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AVbVIns.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AVbVIns.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VX6cLUP.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VX6cLUP.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6jVssdL.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6jVssdL.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JAjFDiu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JAjFDiu.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploader's Nots :: Got it from thebox.bz (private torrent),also included 9 and 12 episodes which is rarely available.
