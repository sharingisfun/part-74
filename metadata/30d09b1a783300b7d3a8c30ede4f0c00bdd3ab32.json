I know Corel was one of them among others. You can take any photo, namely a person's\nface and rearrange it in various ways in Kai's Power GOO functions known as Nudge , Smudge, Smooth, Grow/Shrink, Mirror Toggle and several more. It would take great experience to do this\nin Photoshop for instance. Plus there are over 170 more images on the CD .ISO \n\nYou can use pictures from Scanners, Memory Cards, Video, Digital Cameras as well as make movies\nin standard AVI, QuickTime or 'Goovie' format. GOO is used to create screen savers, T-shirts, Greeting Cards, Mugs, Calendars and what ever else uses imagery. This uses a easy to use floating interface for all ages.\n\nFor those readers who don't read titles or pay attention. This comes WITH the Windows XP Fix!\nMany remember how it hated that's OS. That has been fixed finally! If it runs on Vista or Windows\n7,8 hasn't been tested yet.\n\nPLEASE SEED! PLEASE SEED! PLEASE SEED!\n\nEnjoy Your Software\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d09b1a783300b7d3a8c30ede4f0c00bdd3ab32","amp;dn":"Kais+Power+Goo+%2B+XP+Patch+Fix.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d09b1a783300b7d3a8c30ede4f0c00bdd3ab32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,208,155,26,120,51,0,183,211,168,195,14,222,79,12,0,189,211,171,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
