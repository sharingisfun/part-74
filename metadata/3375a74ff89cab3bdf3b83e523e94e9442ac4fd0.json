This program on flying WAAS approaches with the Garmin 430W/530W gives pilots the knowledge needed to fly these new instrument approaches with confidence. In this program, weÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll examine the redesigned RNAV (GPS) approach charts. YouÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll learn the specifics of LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches and see how they provide ILS-like guidance when using the Garmin 430W, one of the most popular panel-mount units. YouÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll ride along on three flights to see, step-by-step, how to set-up and fly three different GPS approaches including an LPV approach. Learn how the unit provides turn-by-turn guidance for flying procedure turns and holding patterns and how the 430W uses WAAS information to provide an electronic glidepath and more accurate navigation guidance. \n\nApprox. 20 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3375a74ff89cab3bdf3b83e523e94e9442ac4fd0","amp;dn":"Garmin+WAAS+Approaches+430W+%2F+530W+M4V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3375a74ff89cab3bdf3b83e523e94e9442ac4fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,117,167,79,248,156,171,59,223,59,131,229,35,233,78,148,66,172,79,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
