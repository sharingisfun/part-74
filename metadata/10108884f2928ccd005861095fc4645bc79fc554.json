Korporaal Otter, een soldaat uit de partisan divisie, wordt niet alleen geconfronteerd met de Duitsers en Poolse verraders, maar ook met bepaalde dingen uit zijn eigen verleden......\n***********************************************************\nThe narrative follows different twists and turns. The main character, the executioner, acting on previous orders leads his former school friend (an informer) to his death, after spending a night drinking eating and reminiscing. He threatens his former friend's wife (his own former girlfriend) with sexual violence when his initial attempt to coerce his &quot;friend&quot; to leave to be executed fails. His &quot;friend's&quot; final request is then to look after his wife and become her new partner after the execution has taken place. The &quot;friend's&quot; death itself is a bizarre accident. This is later contrasted with the executioner releasing a young woman from his resistance unit who had betrayed his comrades during his absence and is responsible for their deaths. First he tells her a story about a dream in which he makes an analogy to animals who kill the women of his family. He punishes her by forcing her to serve two young German paratroopers toadstool stew cooked with their fellow soldier's cut off head. Difficult to follow, distasteful or just bizarre, this is certainly not the rough justice of the &quot;Inglorious Basterds,&quot; or vengeance in &quot;The Pacific.&quot; For a film that aims to shown the emotional horrors of war and human frailties it lacks authenticity. In parts it feels like a B horror movie. \n\nSource..........: oblawa-xvid-sml\nWIDTH &amp; HEIGHT..: 720 X 576\nFRAMES/S........: 25.000 Fps\nBITRATE.........: 6 154 Kbps\nAUDIO...........: Pools - Polish DD 2.0\nAUDIO CODE......: AC3\nBITRATE.........: 192 Kbps\nCHANNELS........: 2\nSubtitles.......: Selectable : Nederlands(Dutch) - English\n\nVertaald door......: Os2lover voor NLtoppers Great job Thanks! *****\nControle Bewerking Resync...: Gus_Guzzler\n\n[img]http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/2019/bedanktaanonzevertalers.gif[/img]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209266/?ref_=sr_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209266/?ref_=sr_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHeeft u deze film gezien en wilt u ergens een recensie achterlaten?\nga dan eens naar http://www.pheunix.nl\n\n10108884f2928ccd005861095fc4645bc79fc554\n\nNLtopper Yakomo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10108884f2928ccd005861095fc4645bc79fc554","amp;dn":"Oblawa+%282012%29Pal+DVD5%28NL-Engl+subs%29NLtoppers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10108884f2928ccd005861095fc4645bc79fc554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,16,136,132,242,146,140,205,0,88,97,9,95,196,100,91,199,159,197,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
