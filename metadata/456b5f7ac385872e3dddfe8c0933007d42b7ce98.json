There is a fragile warmth as the young singer wrings every emotion imaginable out of her songs; but there is also an unexpected depth that only becomes apparent on songs like Not Gonna Cry and the piano enhanced HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Door which are both exquisite folk songs.\n\nThis now brings me to a song that in many ways couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t and shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be covered, as the original has to be the definitive version; Ring of Fire. Yes; you read correctly Ring of Fire; made famous by Johnny Cash and written by his wife June and Merle Kilgore. Well, dear reader, Laurie Levine is not only very brave for even attempting to put her version on record; but she actually pulls it off and makes it the sexy love song that June and Johnny always wanted it to be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10/10. \n\nSIX WINTERS is a very impressive album from a clever songwriter with an outstanding voice; and well worth checking out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456b5f7ac385872e3dddfe8c0933007d42b7ce98","amp;dn":"laurie+levine+-+six+winters+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456b5f7ac385872e3dddfe8c0933007d42b7ce98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,107,95,122,195,133,135,46,61,221,254,140,9,51,0,125,66,183,206,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
