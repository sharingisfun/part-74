An investigation team enters the ship, discovering a population of sick and malnourished extraterrestrials. The aliens, derogatorily referred to as &quot;prawns&quot;, are confined to District 9, a government camp just outside Johannesburg. Periodic unrest then occurs between the aliens and the locals and subsequently the South African government hires Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp.\n\nIn August 2010, Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an Afrikaner bureaucrat, is appointed by Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar), an MNU executive and his father-in-law, to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, three aliens Ã¢â‚¬â€ Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), his son, and a friend Ã¢â‚¬â€ search for alien technology among the trash heaps and detritus of District 9, from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the canister, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter (David James), a xenophobic soldier leading the military side of the operation.\n\nDisc 1\nFile: DVD9 (ISO)\nMenu': Yes\nLanguage: Ita, Eng\nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1\nSub: Eng, Ita, Greco, Portoghese\nExtra: Yes\nSoftware: DVDFab\nSize: 7,32 GB\n\nDisc 2\nFile: DVD5 (ISO)\nMenu': Yes\nLanguage: Eng\nSottotitoli: Ita, Greco, Portoghese\nExtra: Yes\nSoftware: DVDFab\nSize: 2,05 GB\n\nUse NERO to burn .iso, burn to DVD a low speed for best results, or use DEAMON TOOLS to mount .iso ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a0feb3112864979cf445f6a88adf31253aad95","amp;dn":"District+9+Edition+Two+Disc+DVD9+e+DVD5+ENG+ITA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a0feb3112864979cf445f6a88adf31253aad95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,160,254,179,17,40,100,151,156,244,69,246,168,138,223,49,37,58,173,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
