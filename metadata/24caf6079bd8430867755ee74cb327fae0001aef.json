The opening scenario remains the same: Hamlet's father murdered by his brother who then weds the widowed mother. Hamlet must discover his strength and leadership that will allow him to regain his rightful throne. Don't expect an ending which matches the Bard's though, this is more like a true Viking epic.***This European historical saga presents the true tale of intrigue, regicide, incest, and insanity on which Shakespeare based Hamlet. It begins in the ancient Danish kingdom of\nJutland in the sixth century. There ambitious Prince Fenge (Gabriel Byrne) murders his brother the king and one of his sons, but masks it as the casualty of a highway robbery. The dark prince then claims both the throne and his former sister-in-law, queen Geruth (Helen Mirren). Her son Amled saw the killings, but feigns madness to spare his life. Amled then begins preparing his revenge. Fenge is not convinced of Amled's madness and arranges for a beautiful maid to seduce the truth out of him. That doesn't work so Fenge sends his nephew to visit the Scottish home of his friend Aethelwine (Brian Cox), who will receive orders to kill him. Amled learns of the plot and changes the orders, immediately winning Aethelwine's favor, winning a battle for the man, and marrying his daughter (Kate Beckinsale). Then the resourceful prince travels back to Jutland to deal with his uncle.\n\n\nGeneral\n-------------\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 920 MiB\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate : 1243 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\n--------\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nBit rate : 1 108 Kbps\nWidth : 512 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.225\nStream size : 820 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : XviD 64\n\n\nAudio\n--------\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 94.7 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration : 504 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.99r\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24caf6079bd8430867755ee74cb327fae0001aef","amp;dn":"Prince+of+Jutland+%5BRoyal+Deceit%5D+1994+DVDRip+XviD+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24caf6079bd8430867755ee74cb327fae0001aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,202,246,7,155,216,67,8,103,117,94,231,76,179,39,250,224,0,26,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
