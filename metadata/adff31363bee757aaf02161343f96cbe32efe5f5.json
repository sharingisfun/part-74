While the Ohio-based mope-rockers have always taken a decidedly sullen approach to things, the death of founding member and violin player Noel Sayre just before the Fourth of July in 2008 gave the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distressed songwriting something tangible to latch onto. Occasion For Song, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth full-length album and first post-Sayre, is a heart-on-sleeve memorial to The Black SwansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fallen bandmate. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most shatteringly personal offering to date.\n\nSayreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death glues the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nine tracks together, and the band isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shy about laying all that hurt on the table. Track by track, thoughts and musings on SayreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death loom, and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hushed, delicate music, an effective hybrid of indie-folk, dream pop, and sadcore, is the perfect companion to the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bleak subject matter. Like Neil Young (a notable influence here) on classic Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s albums like Zuma and TonightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Night, The Black Swans prove here that even the bleakest of circumstances can build the foundation for some beautiful music.\n\nLyrically, frontman Jerry DeCiccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words range from the cryptic and enigmatic to those with all the subtlety of a kick to the teeth, but either way thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little escaping the matter at hand. From album opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Basket of LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a long while/ Since IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen you smile/ I want to feel your warmth againÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bound To BeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What do you do when the dark is too dark to see?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Portsmouth, OhioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which lays much of SayreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic story bare (Ã¢â‚¬Å“NobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to die/ Three days before the Fourth of July/ Especially while the sun is still in the skyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Occasion For Song is an open book. While many songwriters tuck their thoughts away in layers of allusion and metaphor, The Black Swans win here braving the misery head-on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adff31363bee757aaf02161343f96cbe32efe5f5","amp;dn":"The+Black+Swans+-+Occasion+for+Song+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adff31363bee757aaf02161343f96cbe32efe5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,255,49,54,59,238,117,122,175,2,22,19,67,249,108,190,50,239,229,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
