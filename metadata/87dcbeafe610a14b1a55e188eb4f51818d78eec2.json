He strengthened the economy by establishing global trade links between Asia and Europe and revitalised the state religion ShiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a Islam which is still practised today.\n\nThe exhibition will demonstrate Shah 'AbbasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social, religious and artistic influence on Iran through the gifts he endowed to major shrines in Mashhad, Ardabil and Qum, and his magnificent new capital at Isfahan.\nThe objects, many of which have not been seen outside Iran, will include exquisite Qur'ans, mosque lamps, paintings, carpets, calligraphy, porcelain and silks.\n\nShah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran is the next major exhibition in the British Museum series focused on great rulers, following The First Emperor: ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Terracotta Army and Hadrian: Empire and Conflict. This is a unique opportunity to discover Shah 'AbbasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contribution to the creation of modern Iran.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87dcbeafe610a14b1a55e188eb4f51818d78eec2","amp;dn":"Shah+Abbas+-+The+Remaking+of+Iran+%28History+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87dcbeafe610a14b1a55e188eb4f51818d78eec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,220,190,175,230,16,161,75,26,85,225,136,235,79,81,129,141,120,238,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
