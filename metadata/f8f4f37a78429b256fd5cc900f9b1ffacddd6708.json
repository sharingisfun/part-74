The IPA produced can then be submitted to a jailbroken appstore, and later support for .DEB to upload to cydia will be added. For windows, tested on Windows 8.\n\nFeedback is always appreciated, please leave a comment if it worked for you and if you encountered any problems :)\n\nThis is an updated version from the last one, and allows you to set the game orientation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f4f37a78429b256fd5cc900f9b1ffacddd6708","amp;dn":"Gamemaker+Studio+Free+IPA+Builder+%28Revision+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f4f37a78429b256fd5cc900f9b1ffacddd6708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,244,243,122,120,66,155,37,111,213,204,144,15,155,31,250,205,221,103,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
