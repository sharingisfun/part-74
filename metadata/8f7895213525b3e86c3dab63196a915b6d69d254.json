Producer John Parish helps the group reach its potential, accentuating the darkness and mystery inherent in its music. There are still a few weak moments on the record, but overall, Low Estate is an impressive leap forward for Sixteen Horsepower, an album that clearly separates the band from its alt-country contemporaries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f7895213525b3e86c3dab63196a915b6d69d254","amp;dn":"16+Horsepower+-+Low+Estate+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f7895213525b3e86c3dab63196a915b6d69d254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,120,149,33,53,37,179,232,108,61,171,99,25,106,145,91,109,105,210,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
