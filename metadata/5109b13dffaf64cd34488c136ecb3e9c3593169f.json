The results are the closest thing to a time capsule to 1973 - or at least to Iggy's subsequent efforts with Williamson, including 1977's Kill City and 1979's New Values - that rock 'n' roll is likely to proffer in this millennium. The new album's opening one-two of Ã¢â‚¬ËœBurnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSex &amp; MoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pair sublimely blunt and self-explanatory subject matter with back alley razor-blade guitars and a troglodytic rhythmic stomp as intensely single-minded as Iggy's lyrical statements of intent. Elsewhere on the album, anthems abound in the form of the most dead-on rallying cry for the lower-working-class dispossessed to date--the succinctly and aptly titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœJobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - as well as a title track that mixes a signature Iggy Pop mission statement of angry desperation with guitar pyrotechnics that recall those halcyon opening salvos of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSearch &amp; DestroyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5109b13dffaf64cd34488c136ecb3e9c3593169f","amp;dn":"Iggy+and+the+Stooges+-+Ready+to+Die+%28Deluxe%29+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5109b13dffaf64cd34488c136ecb3e9c3593169f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,9,177,61,255,175,100,205,52,72,140,19,110,203,62,156,53,147,22,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
