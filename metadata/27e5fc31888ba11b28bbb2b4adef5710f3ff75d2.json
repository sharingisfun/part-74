Farewell (Bonaparte)\t 0:54\n\nDogwood &amp; Holly is a folk band that features traditional acoustic instrumentation - Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, and Bass Fiddle - and incorporates elements of all the traditional American folk sub-genres into original music with a classic Americana flavor. So whether you're a mountain man, a traveler, a homebody, or a hipster, you'll probably hear something you like in their repertoire. Their lyrics deal with spiritual, political, and philosophical matters of importance in a harmonic, front-porch, soap box sort of way, and you can find them playing music anywhere from the backwoods of the Blue Ridge mountains to the abandoned stairwells of academic buildings.\n\nThe quartet, composed of Richie on guitar, Luke on banjo, Audrey on mandolin and Owen on bass fiddle, continues to work, study, and live in Lynchburg, Virginia to this day, playing gigs and sharing music through their debut album, Bonaparte.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e5fc31888ba11b28bbb2b4adef5710f3ff75d2","amp;dn":"Dogwood+and+Holly+-+Bonaparte+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e5fc31888ba11b28bbb2b4adef5710f3ff75d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,229,252,49,136,139,161,27,40,187,178,180,173,239,87,16,243,255,117,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
