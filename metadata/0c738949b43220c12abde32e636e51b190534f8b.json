Particle ray beam weapons, quiet supersonic flight, magnetic levitation and hyper-speed engines are all part of the technology that promises cutting-edge aircraft for 21st century combat. Learn how UCAV Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles - are poised to take the preeminent role in future air combat with their ability to undertake missions too dangerous for human pilots, striking land and air targets with robotic precision. Without the burden of designing for a human pilot, engineers of these robot planes - like Northrop's radical X-47 - are able to achieve some truly space-age designs. Witness the latest applications of stealth technology in aircraft like the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's out-of-this-world &quot;Bird of Prey.&quot; Like the Klingon ship that inspired its name, this experimental plane is completely invisible to detection and truly looks years ahead of its time. But while stealth planes have been around for some time, stealth helicopters are the emerging stars of the air force. Watch as the new Comanche explodes onto the scene, flexing its muscles as the military's newest and deadliest tank killer. Then, climb into the cockpit for an exclusive, first-time tour of the Comanche to see the amazing abilities of this state-of-the-art attack chopper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c738949b43220c12abde32e636e51b190534f8b","amp;dn":"Secrets+Of+Future+Airpower+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c738949b43220c12abde32e636e51b190534f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,115,137,73,180,50,32,193,42,189,227,46,99,110,81,177,144,83,79,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
