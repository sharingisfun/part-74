Frank Ballinger of the Chicago police, a brusque cynic whose tight lips were most often puffing savagely on a cigarette. Even though Marvin was 33, his hair looks gray in these grainy black-and-white tape transfers, and he tends to keep a small snap-brim fedora clamped firmly on his head as the cameras follow him out of the dingy squad room into even dingier exterior locations on mostly marginal Chicago streets.\n\nThe showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s half-hour episodes are textured with prickly details out of hard-boiled pulp. Ballinger grills a suspect in a dive bar called Club Hangover; when he pursues two other malefactors into a beatnik club called El Guitar Coffee House, Marvin, in his Squaresville narrow-lapel cheap suit, wrinkles his small, blunt nose at the wan trilling of a folk-singing duo, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bud and Travis.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The actor makes clear what the script does not: Ballinger thinks the arty types tapping their toes to melancholy chords are callow punks with soft hands. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do the dirty work this cop requires of someone worthy of respect. \n\nThe suspects Ballinger is after in that episode Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fire Makers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ about a gang of arsonists Ã¢â‚¬â€ have familiar, if young, faces: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re played by Leonard Nimoy and James Coburn. Scattered throughout the series are appearances by before-they-were-stars actors like Angie Dickinson (MarvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s co-star in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Point BlankÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Burt Reynolds, Charles Bronson, Don Rickles and (in addition to Mr. Nimoy) another future Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star TrekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ player, DeForest Kelley.\n\nBut the focus centers, as it should, on Marvin. Ã¢â‚¬Å“M SquadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was clearly influenced by the just-the-facts-maÃ¢â‚¬â„¢am storytelling of the more well-known Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dragnet,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which made its television premiere in 1951. Unlike the stiff Jack Webb in that series, however, Marvin is a loose-limbed energy junkie, impatiently jiggling his leg when forced to sit at his squad desk, and possessed of a blithe cockiness thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous fun to watch. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SpecialistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ everyone in one scene looks attentively at a lawyer articulating his defense of three robbers. Not Ballinger, though: with an insolent brazenness worthy of Marlon Brando, Marvin angles his body away from the lawyer and stares at the floor, radiating contempt. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a nice guy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ballinger says at one point in this episode, and you believe him. Cutting off crooks answering his questions as though theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re wasting his time in getting to jail, Marvin creates a man who you just know lives by a pre-Miranda, confess-or-IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll-slug-ya code. \n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“M SquadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ collection is not for DVD lovers who prize visual crispness. Many episodes have a cloudy blur and dropped-out frames that modern technology cannot improve. But there are other saving graces, including a CD of music from the series that has driving jazz from big names like Count Basie and Benny Carter. The showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bopping, squealing, squad-car opening credits were parodied 25 years later on the short-lived cop spoof Ã¢â‚¬Å“Police Squad!,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the satirists who made Ã¢â‚¬Å“Airplane!,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jim Abrahams and the Zucker brothers, David and Jerry.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“M Squad,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ however, is both unironic and, thanks to MarvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pent-up acting, bracingly modern. The series even presaged the current trend of CSI-style forensics. Ballinger frequently tells an underling to save some piece of evidence for Ã¢â‚¬Å“the lab.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As early as the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second episode he was saying, half-derisively, half-admiringly, that the lab was Ã¢â‚¬Å“dousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, burninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and smellinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ some blood and fingerprints on a crime scene. Ballinger concludes with the astringent sarcasm that makes Ã¢â‚¬Å“M SquadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ such a happy rediscovery, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We may as well take the day off, now that the science-fiction boys got it all wrapped up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ KEN TUCKER\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2903e43c8896eecdab1ec16d5c81008b2d4be198","amp;dn":"M+Squad+d2e8-14+Lee+Marvin+DVD5+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2903e43c8896eecdab1ec16d5c81008b2d4be198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,3,228,60,136,150,238,205,171,30,193,109,92,129,0,139,45,75,225,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
