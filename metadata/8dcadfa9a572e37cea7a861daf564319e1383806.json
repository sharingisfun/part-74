The Los Angeles husband-and-wife duo of Deb Talan and Steve Tannen have always made kid-friendly musicÃ¢â‚¬â€the kind of record you buy because you enjoy it, but before you know it, the kids are singing along in the backseatÃ¢â‚¬â€but their latest record is the first theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written as parents, and it shows.\n\nTalan and Tannen havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always been this chipper; they wrote much of their last record when they desperately wanted to have a baby, and the songs were shaded by loneliness and longing. It was called Hideaway, named after a song about how even the stars sometimes canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bear to emerge. They finally became parents between the time they made Hideaway and released it, so even though their world had changed, they spent the last few years performing songs theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d written a lifetime ago. The new mom and dad were probably happier than their music soundedÃ¢â‚¬â€and all that contained joy had to explode at some pointÃ¢â‚¬â€which brings us to Be My Thrill.\n\nFirst track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please Speak Well Of MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is just what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect from a band called The WeepiesÃ¢â‚¬â€a simple waltz with wistful lyrics clearly enunciated by TalanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sugary voiceÃ¢â‚¬â€and would have fit nicely on their breakout record Say I Am You. Next, though, comes the first of three songs about sunshine. The sing-songy Ã¢â‚¬Å“When You Go AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ kicks off a portion of the record that should come preloaded on minivan stereo systems: Ã¢â‚¬Å“When you go away / ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like you hide the sun / Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ When you go away / ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an unfinished song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Talan sings. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Was Made For Sunny DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is exuberant, a modern-day Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Are My SunshineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was made for sunny days / I made do with gray, but I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay / I was made for sunny days / And I was made for youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). And between the handclaps and lyrics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“We hold hands while we work and play / And hope tomorrow is a sunny day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the ridiculously catchy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hope TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ could be the theme song to a PBS Kids show.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HummingbirdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a lullaby, with hushed vocals and tender words; despite its name, so is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not a Lullaby,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with all the key rock-a-bye-baby qualitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€repetitive, reassuring, self-referential lyrics about holding someone when the rain falls. Even on the ostensibly grown-up songs, The WeepiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lyrics seem to have originated from late nights spent soothing their progeny, especially the repetition throughout the otherwise mellow Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red, Red RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know why you do the things you do, do, do / YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re holding it together with some glue, glue, glueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nThe Weepies arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for everyone. Be My Thrill is sweetÃ¢â‚¬â€really sweetÃ¢â‚¬â€and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little sour to balance it out. But Talan and Tannen are disarmingly unapologetic: TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in love with each other, they have an adorable little boy, the weatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing in California, life is beautiful and they write mushy-gushy pop songs about it.\n\nEven in that context, the album delivers some surprises. On the bluesy rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Do You Get High?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tannen takes the lead, asking the title question at least 11 times, while Talan sings sultry harmonies over electric guitars in the background. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great song, and Be My ThrillÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs only bit of muscle, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disorienting in context. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Add My EffortÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is just a little Auto-tune and a sax solo away from airplay on Delilah, in the best way possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unabashed, moody soft-pop. Though the lyrics are a little awkward (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m gonna add my effort to youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€huh?), TalanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s background vocals have never sounded better, almost taking the place of a guitar part. And Ã¢â‚¬Å“TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re In Love, Where Am I?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like a Burt Bacharach cover; the language is intentionally dated (Talan chirps about LoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lane and kissing in the rain, while the vibraphone rings and dings along) and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charmingÃ¢â‚¬â€just slightly out of character.\n\nThe Weepies close their record in the minor keys. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Empty Your HandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is about letting go of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems and releasing them like a bunch of red balloons into a blue skyÃ¢â‚¬â€tooth-achingly sweet, but a picture we could probably all stand to imagine. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a perfect way for the duo to sign off; it somehow justifies their cheeriness, as if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is why we make music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inspiration? Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our baby learned to run today / in circles on the grass / His joyful face it radiates / These moments go so fast,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Talan sings. Parenthood can really change your perspective. Your music, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dcadfa9a572e37cea7a861daf564319e1383806","amp;dn":"The+Weepies+-+Be+My+Thrill+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dcadfa9a572e37cea7a861daf564319e1383806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,202,223,169,165,114,227,124,234,122,134,29,175,86,67,25,225,56,56,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
