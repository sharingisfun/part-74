However, distinguished psychologist Maureen Gaffney believes passionately that not only is it possible for us to flourish, but in an increasingly uncertain world, it is essential that we plan to do so. Flourishing is about achieving a deeper sense of well-being, meaning and purpose despite, and indeed very often because of, adversity. Indeed, Maureen Gaffney explains that adversity can be a positive turning point in our lives if we decide that our goal is not merely returning to the status quo, but having better lives. Her message is that we can do this and in this exciting and innovative book she shows us how. Drawing on her vast experience of working with people and organizations, and on a fascinating body of recent research, Maureen Gaffney has written a gripping, stimulating and inspiring manifesto on how to flourish and why we need to. Learning to flourishÃ¢â‚¬â€and helping others to flourishÃ¢â‚¬â€is the most powerful and worthwhile investment we can make in our own well-being and in our country's future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df19a1510c54c0d28415ddf90844130aaa5b6582","amp;dn":"Flourishing%3A+How+to+Achieve+A+Deeper+Sense+of+Well-Being","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df19a1510c54c0d28415ddf90844130aaa5b6582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,25,161,81,12,84,192,210,132,21,221,249,8,68,19,10,170,91,101,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
