All that's included is the music and artwork, I promise.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom last.fm: \n\n&quot;Based somewhere in the hazy land mass that is North America, Divtech is set to drive a burning hot steak through the heart of the online breakcore networks. Rarely are we privy to such a tinnitus inducing onslaught of cybergrind percussion rushes and chiptune barbarism. Expect Gabber, Heavy Metal, Grindcore and 8-bit blended together with all the fine attention to detail that has come to be expected from the incredibly diverse North American breakcore scene.&quot;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIncludes 4 albums that were all released for free (I think):\n\nD.Y.K.W.Y.C.A.I.Y.W?   (2008)  128/192/320kbps\nCompact Reality Refuse (2009)  320 kbps\nWe Want Your Soul      (2010)  320 kbps\nMusic Is Dead          (2010)  320 kbps\n\nIf you like it, support the artist and buy Machines of Decay (2012) or Rise With The Tide (2013) (links below). They are both only 5 bucks and come with sweet extras, so support this amazing artist and buy something from him.\n\n\nMachines of Decay:\n\nRise With The Tide:\n \nLast fm:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.last.fm/music/Divtech&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.last.fm/music/Divtech&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscogs:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.discogs.com/artist/Divtech&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.discogs.com/artist/Divtech&lt;/a&gt;\nSoundcloud:\n\nSorry if I missed any music or messed up the metadata.
