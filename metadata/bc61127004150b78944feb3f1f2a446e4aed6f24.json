Ivy Malone has a curiosity that sometimes gets her into trouble, and it's only aggravated by her discovery that she can easily escape the public eye. So when vandals romp through the local cemetery, she takes advantage of her newfound anonymity and its unforeseen advantages as she launches her own unofficial investigation. Despite her oddball humor and unconventional snooping, Ivy soon becomes discouraged by her failure to turn up any solid clues. And after Ivy witnesses something ominous and unexplained, she can't resist putting her investigative powers to work again. Even the authorities' attempts to keep Ivy out of danger and her nosy neighbor's match-making schemes can't slow her down. But will the determination that fuels this persistent, quirky sleuth threaten her very safety? &quot;I laughed out loud. McCourtney's charming mystery debuts a voice both enchanting and startling.&quot;-Colleen Coble, author of Without a Trace\n\n----------------------\nIn Plain Sight (2005)\n---\nEver wonder how a little old lady with possum-gray hair could wind up on a homicidal hit list?
