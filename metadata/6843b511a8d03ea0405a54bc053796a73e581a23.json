Down near the docks, many have taken ill, and the fatalities are mounting. Now they include Polly, the serving girl at the Cook Coffeehouse. But fourteen-year-old Mattie Cook doesn't get a moment to mourn the passing of her childhood playmate. New customers have overrun her family's coffee shop, located far from the mosquito-infested river, and Mattie's concerns of fever are all but overshadowed by dreams of growing her family's small business into a thriving enterprise. But when the fever begins to strike closer to home, Mattie's struggle to build a new life must give way to a new fight-the fight to stay alive.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6843b511a8d03ea0405a54bc053796a73e581a23","amp;dn":"Fever+1793+by+Laurie+Halse+Anderson+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6843b511a8d03ea0405a54bc053796a73e581a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,67,181,17,168,208,62,160,64,90,84,188,5,55,150,167,62,88,26,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
