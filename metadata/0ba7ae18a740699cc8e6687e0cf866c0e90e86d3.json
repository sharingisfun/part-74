Week by week, individuals will be eliminated until each celebrity has only one person on their team left to compete for the title of &quot;The Voice of America,&quot; in a live finale. Unlike American Idols' lengthy audition process, the celebrity mentors will select their team members via a blind audition, so they'll only be able to hear their voices. The show will have three stages of competition-the blind audition, a battle phase, and the live performance shows. Viewers will take part in the show by casting votes to help determine the finalists, who are competing for the grand prizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa recording contract.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba7ae18a740699cc8e6687e0cf866c0e90e86d3","amp;dn":"The.Voice.S04E16.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba7ae18a740699cc8e6687e0cf866c0e90e86d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,167,174,24,167,64,105,156,200,230,104,126,12,248,102,192,233,14,134,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
