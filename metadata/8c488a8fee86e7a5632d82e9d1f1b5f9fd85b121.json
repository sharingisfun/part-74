Mitchell was editor-in-chief of The Sun and was a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board for many years.\n\nMitchell introduced many technological and social predictions which were daring for the time, prior to similar predictions by famous authors, such as travel by pneumatic tube, electrical heating, newspapers printed in the home by electrical transmission, food-pellet concentrates, international broadcasts, suspended animation of a living human being through freezing (cryogenics), a man rendered invisible by scientific means, a time-travel machine, faster-than-light travel, a thinking computer, a cyborg, matter transmission or teleportation, voting by American women, and interracial marriage. His fantasy stories dabble with the occult and bizarre, involving ghosts, the Devil, masochism, inanimate objects coming to life, and more.\n\nTHE TACHYPOMP (April 1894),\n\nTHE SOUL SPECTROSCOPE (19 December 1875),\n\nTHE FACTS IN THE RATCLIFF CASE (07 March 1879),\n\nTHE STORY OF THE DELUGE (29 April 1875),\n\nTHE PROFESSOR'S EXPERIMENT (22 February 1880),\n\nTHE INSIDE OF THE EARTH (27 February 1876),\n\nTHE BALLOON TREE (25 February 1883),\n\nOLD SQUIDS AND LITTLE SPELLER (19 July 1885),\n\nTHE MAN WITHOUT A BODY (25 March 1877),\n\nTHE ABLEST MAN IN THE WORLD (04 May 1879),\n\nTHE SENATOR'S DAUGHTER (27 July 1879),\n\nTHE CRYSTAL MAN (30 January 1881),\n\nTHE CLOCK THAT WENT BACKWARD (18 September 1881),\n\nand 17 more are contained in this anthology, 30 in all, with an introduction about The Sun by the contributor of this work to Feedbooks' public domain collection.
