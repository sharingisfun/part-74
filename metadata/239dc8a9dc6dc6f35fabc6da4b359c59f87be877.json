For driver Jason, driving the trains on the 'Real Ale Trail' is the most dreaded shift of the week as drunken party-goers fill his carriages and begin to stumble across the tracks to catch their trains. Elsewhere, when a teenager is killed after trespassing on the track, British Transport Police officer Craig has the difficult task of breaking the news to the boy's mother. To add to the challenges for staff, it is the wettest summer in a century and flooding brings the network to a standstill. With costly fines for every minute of delay, just one day of flooding costs the industry over a million pounds and ruins thousands of passengers' days.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239dc8a9dc6dc6f35fabc6da4b359c59f87be877","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Railway+Keeping+Britain+on+Track+2of6+Summer+Madness+720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239dc8a9dc6dc6f35fabc6da4b359c59f87be877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,157,200,169,220,109,198,243,95,171,198,218,75,53,156,89,248,123,232,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
