The items are then sold at auction, where the antiquers compete for the highest profit, which is most often determined by the lowest loss.\nMarket Warriors has a number of connections to Antiques Roadshow, being hosted by Mark L. Walberg, and the participation of appraiser Miller Gaffney, Kevin Bruneau, John Bruno, Bene Raia.\n\n\nAntiquing in Rochester, MN   April 15 2013     \n\n    \nAuction House: Ken Farmer Auctions &amp; Appraisals, Radford, VA\n\nShopping Location: Gold Rush Show, Rochester, MN\n\n\n640 X 360\n\n900 Kbps\n\n29 fps\n\n353 MB\n\nRuntime: 53:09\n\n\nDid not air on some local PBS stations on April 15 like it was scheduled for some reason.\n\n\nBajskorv HD version(TVteam) of this episode @ 1.63 MB is just way too big a download for most.
