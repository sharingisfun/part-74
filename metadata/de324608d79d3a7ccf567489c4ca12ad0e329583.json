Kenner (January 1st 2013) \n\nFor fans of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes an erotic, emotionally charged romance between a powerful man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a fiery woman who says Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on her own terms. \n\nHe was the one man I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t avoid. And the one man I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist. \n\nDamien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.\n\nOur attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and risk breaking us apart.\n\nBut Damien was haunted, too.

For me, it is fiercely, blindingly, real.\n\nDamien StarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need is palpableÃ¢â‚¬â€his need for pleasure, his need for control, his need for me. Beautiful and brilliant yet tortured at his core, he is in every way my match.\n\nI have agreed to be his alone, and now I want him to be fully mine. I want us to possess each other beyond the sweetest edge of our ecstasy, into the deepest desires of our souls. To let the fire that burns between us consume us both.\n\nBut there are dark places within Damien that not even our wildest passion can touch. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. But our troubled pasts will either bind us close . . . or shatter us completely.\n\nClaim Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de324608d79d3a7ccf567489c4ca12ad0e329583","amp;dn":"Stark+Trilogy+%281-2%29+by+J.+Kenner+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de324608d79d3a7ccf567489c4ca12ad0e329583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,50,70,8,215,157,58,124,207,86,116,137,196,202,18,173,14,50,149,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
