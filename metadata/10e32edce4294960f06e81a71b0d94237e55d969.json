Different video's with different quality. So don't expect the complete concert to look top notch.\nBut most of it turned out quite nice.\n\nDuring the synchronisation of the video I realized sometimes the audio sounds a lot better, when taken from different sources.\nSo instead of just using my version 2 audio as soundtrack, I decided to make a new mix.\nWith some audio elements of the better sounding video's are mixed in. Some of them are lossy. So the LPCM track is not completely lossless.\n\nThere are two versions of the mix available. The 5.1 mix and the stereo mix. Both are made from the same elements, but mixed together differently.\nFor me the 5.1 mix is the preferable mix. Because it uses more speakers, it just sounds more natural.\n\nSongs:\nIntroduction - Flash/The Hero\nSeven Seas of Rhye\nKeep Yourself Alive\nWe Will Rock You (fast)\nFat Bottomed Girls\nDon't Stop Me Now\nUnder Pressure\nI Want It All\nWho Wants To Live Forever\nA Kind Of Magic\nDays Of Our Lives\nSomebody to Love\nLove of my Life\n39\nDragon Attack\nDrum Battle\nLast Horizon\nBrighton Rock Solo\nI Want To Break Free\nAnother One Bites The Dust\nRadio Ga Ga\nCrazy Little Thing Called Love\nThe Show Must Go On\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nTie Your Mother Down\nWe Will Rock You\nWe Are The Champions\nGod Save The Queen\n\nTechnical details:\nRuntime: 2h 07m\nAudio track 1: 24 bit LPCM stereo\nAudio track 2 384 kbps 5.1 surround AC3\n\nUsed software:\nMicrosoft Windows 7\nMicrosoft Windows Xp\nUbuntu Linux 12.4\nAdobe Audition\nSony Vegas\nVirtualdub\nAvisynth\nHCenc\nAften AC3 encoder\nDVDMaestro\n\nVideo sources (Youtube or Queenzone usernames):\nadamlambertbe, Artistsupporter, FreddieFreak86, gavitana, Hollandfan3, Jack260988, jungpeter1958gmail, Sikkevanderveen, VampGirlPrague, Vanglam76 and Wer-Al_Zwowe.\n\nAudio sources:\ngavitana, jungpeter1958gmail, Kyo_jp, Sikkevanderveen, VampGirlPrague, Vanglam76 and Wer-Al_Zwowe\n\nI want to thank all the people who allowed me to use their video's.
