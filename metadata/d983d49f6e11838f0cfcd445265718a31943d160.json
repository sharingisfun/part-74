She is 25 years old, but     \nunlike her contemporaries, she is still not   \nmarried. The reason for this is her being a   \nmember of a poor family. Her father left the  \nfamily; Her mother is an old homemaker; Her   \nelder sister is a young widow; Her nephews    \nhave to go to school while their father, Her  \nbrother is an inebriated and unemployed man.  \nAll the members of this family live in one    \nlittle house. She is the only one who takes   \ncare of them. She is the only one who works   \nto support the family. She is concerned for   \nher nephews' future and makes her best to     \nbring them up and educate them.               \nHowever, secretly, she dreams of the day      \nwhen she could also have her own family,      \nhusband and children.
