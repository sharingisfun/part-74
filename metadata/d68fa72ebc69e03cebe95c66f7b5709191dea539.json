What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics.\n\nRecently a full video of the debate has surfaced, allowing a group of Dutch anarchists to assist in a new translation of the debate. Now that this project has been completed, we can finally share the first version of the full Chomsky-Foucault debate with English subtitles.\n\nIn his book, The Passion of Michel Foucault, James Miller recounts that, while Chomsky and Foucault prepared for the debate in the preceding hours, Ã¢â‚¬Å“there were already signs that this was not going to be any ordinary debateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½:\n\nHoping to puncture the prim sobriety of the Dutch audience, the programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s host, Fons Elders, a professed anarchist, had obtained a bright red wig, which he tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Foucault to wear. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Chomsky, Foucault had received, in partial payment for his appearance, a large chunk of hashish, which for months afterwards, Foucault and his Parisian friends would jokingly refer to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chomsky hash.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n======\nThanks to those responsible for putting this all together.
