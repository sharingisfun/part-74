Who says history can't be fun? In the hands of Professor Jones, how could it be anything else?&quot; Observer &quot;Jones really knows his subject, he is also a passionate apologist for the Middle Ages... and you also learnt things which made your view of the period a little more complex&quot; Independent &quot;Jones is a reliable and accurate guide to his period, mercifully free from the pomposity that afflicts so many telly historians. Three cheers for Terry Jones&quot; London Evening Standard &quot;Brimming with life, colour, and yes, facts too&quot; Daily Telegraph\n\n\nAbout the Author\nTerry Jones is best known as a member of Monty Python but he has also written books on medieval England, Chaucer's Knight, the highly acclaimed Who Murdered Chaucer? and Crusades, as well as Terry Jones' Barbarians, which accompanied a major television series he presented in 2006. He is the author of several children's books including Fairy Tales and Fantastic Stories, The Knight and the Squire and The Lady and the Squire. He has directed several feature films: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, The Meaning of Life, Personal Services, Erik the Viking and The Wind in the Willows. Alan Ereira has worked as an award-winning producer and writer of history programmes on radio and television for over 40 years, and has collaborated with Terry for ten years on a number of historical films. His previous books include The People's England, The Invergordon Mutiny, The Heart of the World and (with Terry Jones) Crusades and Terry Jones' Barbarians.
