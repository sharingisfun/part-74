The rich seek to satisfy their desires and derive pleasure for themselves, and Tokyo has materialized into such a city as a result. Saiga, once a war photographer, works for Hibara Ginza in the capitalist state of Tokyo. He infiltrates the Roppongi Club, a secretive base located in the red light district of the city, to collect information about them. However, he was caught in the process and brought forward to a girl called Kagura who was in the midst of a ritual. His contact with Kagura awakens his special ability: the power to make things explode when photographed. In order to unravel the mystery behind the Roppongi Club and Kagura, Saiga begins his solitary battle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bdcd7457c22587c4cfa3460c77cb2337876d01a","amp;dn":"Speed+Grapher+Episodes+1+-+24+English+Dubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bdcd7457c22587c4cfa3460c77cb2337876d01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,220,215,69,124,34,88,124,76,250,52,96,199,124,178,51,120,118,208,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
