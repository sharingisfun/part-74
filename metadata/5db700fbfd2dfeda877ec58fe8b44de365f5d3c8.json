Newton defines an Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsolved caseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as being one that either has no suspect identified, a known offender who cannot be charged for lack of concrete evidence, or a miscarriage of justice. The book has been updated to include 93 new unsolved crimes, omit crimes from the first edition that have been solved, and add information to preexisting entries. Entries are arranged alphabetically by the individual victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name, event, popular nickname of an unidentified offender, geographic location, or recognized media label for multiple victims. Cross-references and an index assist users in locating information on their crimes of interest. A bibliography of sources at the end of the volume encourage one to look for more information on unsolved crimes. Suitable for college or public libraries, this book will entertain and inform any mystery or crime aficionado with factual and well-researched information. --Sara Marcus --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Unsolved-Crimes-Facts-Library/dp/081607819X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367950328&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=unsolved+crimes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Unsolved-Crimes-Facts-Library/dp/081607819X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367950328&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=unsolved+crimes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5db700fbfd2dfeda877ec58fe8b44de365f5d3c8","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Unsolved+Crimes+%28Facts+on+File+Crime+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5db700fbfd2dfeda877ec58fe8b44de365f5d3c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,183,0,251,253,45,254,218,135,126,197,143,232,180,77,227,101,245,211,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
