A most rewarding and unusual historical novel.&quot; --The New Yorker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb5708a353054b6ecb7eb5d6b72c5540780ff68","amp;dn":"H.F.M.+Prescott+-+The+Man+on+a+Donkey+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb5708a353054b6ecb7eb5d6b72c5540780ff68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,181,112,138,53,48,84,182,236,183,235,93,107,114,197,84,7,128,255,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
