The meddlers at Wikipedia say:\n\nWarp!, also spelled Warp, was an American science-fiction play created at Chicago, Illinois' Organic Theatre Company in 1971 by co-authors Stuart Gordon and Lenny Kleinfeld, the latter under the pseudonym Bury St. Edmund. The play moved to Broadway for a short run in February 1973. The play and its backstory became the basis for spinoff comic books and other media.\n\nThe alternative comics company First Comics published the spin-off comic-book series Warp, which ran 19 issues cover-dated March 1983 to February 1985.\n\nThe premiere issue featured a 20-page Lord Cumulus story by writer Peter B. Gillis, penciler and cover artist Frank Brunner, and inker Bob Smith; and an eight-page story starring Sargon, Mistress of War, by writer John Ostrander, penciler Lenin Delsol, and inker Joe Staton. Brunner would continue as penciler through issue #9, after which he was succeeded by Jerry Bingham except for two issues, #16 (penciled by Bill Willingham) and #19 (penciled and inked by Mike Gustovich, the regular inker for most of the series' run). The backup features rotated among &quot;Sargon, Mistress of War&quot; by Ostrander, Delsol and Staon; &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, by writer Jack C. Harris and artist Steve Ditko; &quot;Valaria, Insect Sorceress&quot;, by writer Gillis, penciler Willingham, and inker Bruce Patterson; and &quot;Outrider&quot;, by Gillis and various artists.\n\nFirst Comics additionally published Warp Special #1-3 (July 1983, Jan. &amp; June 1984), by writer Gillis and pencilers Howard Chaykin, Mark Silvestri, and George Freeman, respectively.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that each of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!\n\nProps to the creative teams and the scanners!
