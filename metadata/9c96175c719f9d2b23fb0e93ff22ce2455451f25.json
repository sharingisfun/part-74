Scientists have made significant progress in identifying these faults and in measuring and locating earthquakes in the area, but new faults continue to appear. The recent quake that struck the Northridge area in January 1994 exposed a previously unknown fault line, and proved once again that earthquakes are nearly impossible to predict with any precision. Nonetheless, many experts believe that a serious earthquake will strike the Los Angeles area in the near future. This episode of NOVA explores the effects of the Northridge quake and raises questions about predicting and preparing for 'The Big One.'&quot;\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S22E06.-.Killer.Quake!.mp4 (489MB)\nResolution: 706x480 (native DVD)\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.96fps\nSubtitles: English\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=22.5 (a bit higher quality as this is an older/rarer episode, so it's &quot;archival&quot;)\nOriginally broadcast: 1994-Nov-15\n\nNote: Wikipedia calls this episode S21E16 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\nThis episode doesn't seem to have been posted yet, so I'm happy to give back for the almost two hundred episodes of this amazing show that I've found here.\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others!
