Paul relays key intel regarding the globalist confab's merger with Google, the ultimate Big Brother that makes George OrwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1984 look like a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fairy tale. \n\nOn today's transmission, Alex welcomes digital privacy advocate and talk radio host Dr. Katherine Albrecht to explain Google's eerie role in erecting a massive spy network against the people. \n\nAlex also invites comedian, actor and author of Hit List, Richard Belzer to examine the government's latest staged events, the Benghazi debacle and why another false flag terror event is likely in store for the near future.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
