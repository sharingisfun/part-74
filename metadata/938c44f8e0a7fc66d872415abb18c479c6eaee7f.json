It's the Starchild's turn to rock a solo riff in &quot;Goodbye&quot; -- an interstellar romp featuring a cosmic bounty hunter who needs to bring in one last bad guy in order to return home to his beloved wife forever. The only problem is, nobody's ever gone after this baddie in his dark domain and survived. But what if there is a star to light the way? Written by Tom Waltz (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) and illustrated by Tone Rodriguez (Violent Messiahs).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938c44f8e0a7fc66d872415abb18c479c6eaee7f","amp;dn":"KISS+Solo+2+The+Starchild+IDW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938c44f8e0a7fc66d872415abb18c479c6eaee7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,140,68,248,224,167,252,102,216,114,65,90,187,24,196,121,198,234,238,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
