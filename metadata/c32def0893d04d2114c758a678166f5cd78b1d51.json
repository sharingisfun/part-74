You can easily burn it through using Nero or IMGBurn\n\nOfficers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael PeÃƒÂ±a) have formed a powerful brotherhood to ensure they both go home at the end of watch.

Seen from the point of view of the officers, gang members, surveillance cameras, dash cams and citizens caught in the line of fire, a 360Ã‚Â° perspective creates a gritty, compassionate and intense portrait of the city's darkest streets, and the brave men and women patrolling them.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nDeleted Scenes\nEnd Of Watch: Behind The Scenes Featurettes - Fate With A Badge, In The Streets, Women On Watch, Watch Your Six, Honors\nFeature Commentary With Writer/Director David Ayer\n\nRemember folks.
