It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart; two singles taken from the album, Nash's &quot;Just A Song Before I Go&quot; and Stills' &quot;Fair Game&quot; peaked at #7 and #43 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn the interim since their last studio album of original material (1970's DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu), Crosby and Nash had recorded three albums as a duo. Stills pursued other projects, including a short career with Manassas and an album and tour with Young.\nCSN featured strong writing from all three members, the last time for seventeen years that the band would compose songs and handle vocals without major assistance from outside sources. The production of the album fit in well with the ruling aesthetic of the time as featured in other blockbusters such as the Eagles' Hotel California, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours: well-crafted, melodic songs played with precision and balance, essaying the personal travails of the authors.\nMany of Stills' songs on the album echo his marital problems, with &quot;Dark Star&quot; returning to the Latin rhythms he had favored all the way back to his Buffalo Springfield days. Crosby continued the existential probings consistent with much of his past work, and Nash offered both a radio-ready acoustic ballad with &quot;Just a Song Before I Go&quot;, and an elaborate set piece re-creating a vision of an LSD experience that he had in Winchester Cathedral with &quot;Cathedral&quot;. Many tracks were sweetened with a string section, a first on a CSNY project.\nThe album was released for compact disc on October 25, 1990, and then remastered at Ocean View Digital from the original tapes and reissued on September 20, 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;Shadow Captain&quot; (Crosby, Craig Doerge) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n2. &quot;See the Changes&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n3. &quot;Carried Away&quot; (Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n4. &quot;Fair Game&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n5. &quot;Anything at All&quot; (Crosby) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n6. &quot;Cathedral&quot; (Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:15\n7. &quot;Dark Star&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n8. &quot;Just a Song Before I Go&quot; (Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:12\n9. &quot;Run from Tears&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09\n10. &quot;Cold Rain&quot; (Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:32\n11. &quot;In My Dreams&quot; (Crosby) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:10\n12. &quot;I Give You Give Blind&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:21\n\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Rock\nSource:CD \nFormat : FLAC\n\nAudio\n* * * MediaInspector for Mac - Version 2.0.1, build 900\n* * * Ã‚Â©2012 by Diego Massanti\n* * * MediaInfo Lib by Jerome Martinez\n* * * Raw File Report for CROSBY, STILLS &amp; NASH - CSN.flac\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : /Volumes/Flac/Crosby,Stills,Nash &amp; Young/(1977) Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young - CSN [FLAC]/CROSBY, STILLS &amp; NASH - CSN.flac\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nFile size : 245 MiB\nDuration : 44mn 11s\nOverall bit rate : 776 Kbps\nAlbum : CSN\nTrack name : See The Changes\nTrack name/Position : 02\nPerformer : CROSBY, STILLS &amp; NASH\nGenre : Folk/Rock\nRecorded date : 1977\nComment : Track 2\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 44mn 11s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 776 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 245 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.0 (UTC 2007-07-15)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3f9a19c1bf1052cb6412556523149a3dc6f545","amp;dn":"%281977%29+Crosby%2C+Stills%2C+Nash+-+CSN+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3f9a19c1bf1052cb6412556523149a3dc6f545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,63,154,25,193,191,16,82,203,100,18,85,101,35,20,154,61,198,245,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
