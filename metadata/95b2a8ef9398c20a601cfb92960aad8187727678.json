When he was killed in the line of duty, Danny discovered that he continued to exist as an &quot;Earth-bound spirit.&quot; He decided to continue fighting crime as the Duke of Darkness.\n\nHis powers include intangibility, flight, super strength, and the ability to perceive &amp; battle ghosts and demons. Even though he's a &quot;ghost,&quot; he is able to be knocked out by a bump on the head such as in his first adventure. The Duke of Darkness battles villains such as Professor Evil and Mr. Slumber, who attack people through their dreams. A police captain whom Danny once served under viewed the Duke of Darkness as a very mundane nutcase and kept trying to lock him up. Although Danny could escape at any time, he humored his former boss in between solving crimes. \n\n\nSeed so all will enjoy! sharing is caring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b2a8ef9398c20a601cfb92960aad8187727678","amp;dn":"Duke+of+Darkness+Collection%21+Complete%21+1945+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b2a8ef9398c20a601cfb92960aad8187727678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,178,168,239,147,152,194,10,96,28,251,146,150,10,173,129,135,114,118,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
