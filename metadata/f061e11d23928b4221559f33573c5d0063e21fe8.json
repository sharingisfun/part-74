Leave An Open Door\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the release of their latest CD, Ã‚Â¡Americano!, Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers have crossed their Rubicon. \n\nÃ‚Â¡Americano! is an amazing blend of the gut level, rock-n-roll intensity front man Roger Clyne displayed while leading MercuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Refreshments, and the deep, philosophical muse he consulted when he wrote The PeacemakersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ third album, Sonoran Hope and Madness. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s themes are extensive. Touching on love and life, war and death, rogues and revolution, its songs whisk you into a whirling world of chaos, where loving is worth the risk, living is worth the price of dying, and water and blood flow freely. I don't think this masterpiece will be leaving my CD changer for months to come, and I know I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be pressing the skip button when I listen to this one. Ever.
