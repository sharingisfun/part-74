Before horn-head, before the crusader with a cape, before the guy who wears a skull on his chest, before the crawler of walls, there was...THE ORIGINALS! Based on a true historical event! In Feb, 1945, an object (or objects) appeared in the night sky above Los Angeles. The US anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, and over 1000 shells were fired at this object(s), but to no avail, nothing was brought down. What this object was remains a mystery to this day! Moonstone has unearthed the classified govt documents that show the real truth! The Phantom Detective, The Black Bat, Domino Lady, G-8, and Secret Agent X all teamed up to get rid of this threat!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260f0592480f6252c4152ee470a46c2a1ef24537","amp;dn":"The+Battle+for+L.A.+%28Pulp+Heroes%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260f0592480f6252c4152ee470a46c2a1ef24537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,15,5,146,72,15,98,82,196,21,46,228,112,164,108,42,30,242,69,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
