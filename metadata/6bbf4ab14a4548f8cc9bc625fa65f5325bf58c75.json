Anything a client wants Joe can arrange for them, whether it be dancing girls or an article in a prominent magazine. Part of the job however is drinking and Joe's ability to consume alcohol seems boundless. When he meets the very pretty Kirsten Arnasen, she prefers chocolate to alcohol but Joe has a solution to that in the form of a Brandy Alexander (made up of brandy and creme de cocoa). They eventually marry but their love is insufficient to prevent them from the downward spiral that alcohol brings to them. They try desperately to break the habit but continually relapse until only one of them manages to break free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbf4ab14a4548f8cc9bc625fa65f5325bf58c75","amp;dn":"Days+of+Wine+and+Roses+1962+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbf4ab14a4548f8cc9bc625fa65f5325bf58c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,191,74,177,74,69,72,248,204,155,198,37,250,101,245,50,91,245,140,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
