Out of the forty-five original passengers and crew, only sixteen made it off the mountain alive. For ten excruciating weeks they suffered deprivations beyond imagining, confronting nature head-on at its most furious and inhospitable. And to survive, they were forced to do what would have once been unthinkable ...\n\nThis is their story -- one of the most astonishing true adventures of the twentieth century.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;A GREAT BOOK ... AN INCREDIBLE SAGA.
