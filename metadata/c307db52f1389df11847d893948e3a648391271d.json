It was released on November 18, 2003; only the Mac OS X version was published by Feral Interactive.[2] Loosely based on the 1984 Belgian comic book XIII, the player controls (through a first-person view) the protagonist Jason Fly (XIII), a confused and amnesic man who searches for his identity throughout a comic book-style, cel-shaded world. Found stranded on a beach by a lifeguard, Fly is accused of having killed the President of the United States. The accusation later transpires as mistaken, as Fly finds himself facing a gang of 20 conspirators (&quot;The XX&quot;) who aim to overthrow the government. Fly confronts his antagonist (Walter Sheridan (I), the boss of the gang) and the game ends with a dialogue, promising a sequel which was never created.\nThe game received mixed reception by publications, earning 76/100 and 74/100 by the aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. While most praised the story and the graphics, several critics noted rather dry gameplay. The game was also commercially unsuccessful. Notwithstanding, its soundtrack, composed by members of the music label Future Primitive Sound and inspired by the 1970s-era music and hip-hop, was well received. XIII was released for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox consoles and the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. A reimagining of XIII, the point-and-click adventure game XIII: Lost Identity, was released on October 17, 2011 for PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad only.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c307db52f1389df11847d893948e3a648391271d","amp;dn":"XIII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c307db52f1389df11847d893948e3a648391271d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,7,219,82,241,56,157,241,24,71,216,147,148,142,58,100,131,145,39,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
