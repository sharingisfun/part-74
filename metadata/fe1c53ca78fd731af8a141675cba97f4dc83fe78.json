Lee Marvin plays Major Reisman, assigned to coordinate a suicide mission on a French chateau held by top Nazi officers. Since no &quot;normal&quot; GI can be expected to volunteer for this mission, Reisman is compelled to draw his personnel from a group of military prisoners serving life sentences. This &quot;dirty dozen&quot; includes a sex pervert (Telly Savalas), a psycho (John Cassavetes), a retarded killer (Donald Sutherland), and the equally malevolent Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker. On the dim promise of receiving pardons if they survive, the criminals undergo a brutal training program, then are marched behind enemy lines dressed as Nazi soldiers, the better to overtake the chateau and kill everyone in it--including the innocent wives and mistresses of the German officers.\n\nLee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, John Cassavetes\n\n-----------------------\n\nEXTERNAL GREEK SUBTITLES\n\n-----------------------\n\nwww.omifast.net\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1c53ca78fd731af8a141675cba97f4dc83fe78","amp;dn":"Dirty+Dozen++%281967%29+BRrip+XviD+%5BGreek+Subs%5D+Omifast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1c53ca78fd731af8a141675cba97f4dc83fe78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,28,83,202,120,253,115,26,248,161,65,103,92,186,151,244,220,131,254,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
