Blige, produced by Dr. Dre. It was taken from her fifth album, &quot;No More Drama&quot;. The single topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks from November 3, 2001. It was Blige's first Hot 100 number-one single. In 2008, for Billboard magazine's 50th Anniversary, &quot;Family Affair&quot; was listed as the 79th-biggest single on the The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. while at the end of 2009 was named the 12th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. Rolling Stone ranked it number ninety-five on their list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         CONTEMPORARY R&amp;B (2000 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2009)\n\n          By the 2000s, the cross-pollination between R&amp;B and hip hop had increased to the point where, in most cases, the only prominent difference between a record being a hip hop record or an R&amp;B record is whether its vocals are rapped or sung. Mainstream modern R&amp;B has a sound more based on rhythm than hip hop soul had, and lacks the hardcore and soulful urban Ã¢â‚¬Å“grindingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel on which hip-hop soul relied. That rhythmic element descends from new jack swing. R&amp;B began to focus more on solo artists rather than groups as the 2000s progressed. As of 2005, the most prominent R&amp;B artists include Usher, BeyoncÃƒÂ©  and Mariah Carey whose music often blurs the line between contemporary R&amp;B and pop.\n\n           \nLUCY PEARL  - DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T MESS WITH MY MAN   (2000)\nWYCLEF JEAN &amp; MARY J.BLINGE -  911  (2000)\nTONI BRAXTON  -  HE WASNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T MAN ENOUGH   (2000)\nMARY J BLIGE  -  Family Affair  (2001)\nNELLY  -  Pimp  Juice   (2002)\nWYCLEF JEAN &amp; CLAUDETTE ORTIZ  -  TWO WRONGS   (2002)\nFAITH EVANS  -  Mesmerized   (2005)\nR.KELLY Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Slow Wind    (2005)\nT-PAIN  feat.
