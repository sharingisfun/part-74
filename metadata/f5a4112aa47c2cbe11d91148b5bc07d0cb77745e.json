They will weaken the strength \nof universty teacher unions.  They will allow students to participate\nregardless of geographic location, or economic wealth.  Increasingly \ncourses will become &quot;star professor&quot; driven, where the top professors\n(from the top schools) have huge enrollment, and other less well known\ninstructors are ignored.  State and provincial governments will create \nonline universities, consisting entirely of MOOCs, in order to offer \ncourses and degrees with full credentials.  This will be done partly to \nserve remote students in rural areas, but mainly to force the existing urban\nuniversities to accept MOOC course equivalents for their degree programs.\nThe importance of colleges, which teach practical skills which demand\nhands-on training with specific equipment and tools will increase. \nOnline courses have difficulty competing in this area of course. \n\n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Clean, Well-Lighted Place\nA Death in the Woods\nA Good Man Is Hard to Find\nA Hunger Artist\nA Perfect Day forÃ‚Â Bananafish\nA Rose for Emily\nA Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\nA&amp;P\nAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\nBabylon Revisited\nBarn Burning\nBrokeback Mountain\nCathedral\nChekhov Stories\nContinuity of Parks\nDubliners\nEveryday Use\nEverything That Rises Must Converge\nFranny and Zooey\nGirl\nHarrison Bergeron\nHills Like White Elephants\nI Stand Here Ironing\nInterpreter of Maladies\nMelville Stories\nOdour of Chrysanthemums\nPaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Case?
