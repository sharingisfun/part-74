The quality is superb, and all episodes are the complete and uncensored originals. They only lack the opening and closing titles. This is an advantage in order to watch many episodes comfortably and without interruption. The only flaw is that the opening &amp; closing titles are totally missing. I personally coundn't find them anywhere except in YouTube.\n\nIf anyone would ask, I got these rips from an other torrent. After that I renamed the files, sort them into folders and added some extra features which I downloaded from elsewhere, such as the soundtrack album and the four movies.\n\nVIDEO recommendation: In the nowadays average case of having a widescreen monitor or TV, now it'd be perfect to set your player (such as VLC) to an aspect ratio of 16:10.\n\nAUDIO recommendation: For all non-Japanese speaking people, it is strongly recommended that you keep the original Japanese audio and help yourselves with the English subtitles. In case you use the VLC player, to set the Japanese audio track as default during a playlist, paste the characters Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾ in: Tools&gt;Preferences&gt;Audio settings.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a21f9591ac1de11083636174db47e9f90dac90","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+%281986-1989%29+TV+anime+series%3B+Uncensored+%26amp%3B+remast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6a21f9591ac1de11083636174db47e9f90dac90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,162,31,149,145,172,29,225,16,131,99,97,116,219,71,233,249,13,172,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
