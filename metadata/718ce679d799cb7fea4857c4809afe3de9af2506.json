Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father that owns a zoo tells that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States of America. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger that he called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hunger, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718ce679d799cb7fea4857c4809afe3de9af2506","amp;dn":"Life+Of+Pi+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718ce679d799cb7fea4857c4809afe3de9af2506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,140,230,121,215,153,203,127,234,72,87,196,128,154,254,61,233,175,37,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
