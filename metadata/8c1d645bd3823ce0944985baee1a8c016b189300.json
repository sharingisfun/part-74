My first torrent ever! Sorry if it blows.\n\nGabe has a severe gambling addiction and is a total dick. He, like, made his parents sell their home to use the money for gambling.\nVanessa is a shopaholic (which should not be a word; rather, she has a shopping addiction), but the REAL story is that she was an original character on ER until her OCD/ADHD/Anxiety/Agoraphobia/Allergies caused her to take a mental leave from the show. Her voice is quite annoying, but I really feel for her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1d645bd3823ce0944985baee1a8c016b189300","amp;dn":"Intervention+S01E02+Gabe+%26amp%3B+Vanessa.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1d645bd3823ce0944985baee1a8c016b189300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,29,100,91,211,130,60,224,148,73,133,186,238,26,140,1,107,24,147,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
