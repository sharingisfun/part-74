Unfortunately the group did not survive the year but Gryce and Byrd did combine for several memorable recordings, including an excellent Prestige LP reissued on this CD. Their quintet (with pianist Wade Legge, bassist Wendell Marshall, and drummer Art Taylor) turn &quot;Love for Sale&quot; into a jazz waltz (an innovation for 1957), introduce Gryce's best-known composition &quot;Minority,&quot; swing &quot;Zing Went the Strings of My Heart,&quot; and perform a tricky but memorable blues line &quot;Straight Ahead.&quot; This is exciting and still fresh-sounding bebop.
