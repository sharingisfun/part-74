He comes across a story about a man who was killed by his mistress Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a prostitute named Myung-ja. Apparently Myung-ja was raped by a married man who incidentally suffered from impotence, but the assault turns into a prolonged love affair. After much contemplation, Myung-ja asks her man to be his concubine. Surprisingly, the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife agrees to it and even arranges Myung-ja to live with them in exchange for curing her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potency. But what no one has yet to see is that something horrific is heading their way.
