Photomatix offers two ways to solve this problem: Exposure Blending: Merge differently exposed photographs into one image with increased dynamic range. Tone Mapping: Reveal highlight and shadow details in an HDR image created from multiple exposures. The tone mapped image is ready for printing while showing the complete dynamic range captured.\n\nSaving on lighting equipment\nGiven that most digital cameras can auto-bracket at different exposures, you do not need to acquire expensive lighting equipment -and carry it- when shooting high contrast scenes. Just enable Auto Exposure Bracketing, and let Photomatix merge your photos into an image with extended dynamic range.\n\nSaving time in post-processing\nPhotomatix Pro is designed for productivity -- automatic blending, unlimited stacking, easy comparison of results and batch processing save hours of masking and layers work in image editing programs.\n\nTaking advantage of your 32-bit images\nHave you created a 32-bit HDR image in Photoshop CS2 and could not get a good HDR conversion? The Photomatix Tone Mapping tool may help. See how it compares to Photoshop CS2 HDR conversion.\n\nGreat pictures on cloudy days\nShadowless hazy sunlight or an overcast sky usually results in dull-looking photographs. The tone mapping tool of Photomatix Pro can turn them into great-looking images. Check this image as example.\n\nNoise reduction\nThe Exposure Blending functions of Photomatix Pro merge any number of bracketed photos -- this process is equivalent to image stacking, which tends to reduce noise in the resulting image.\n\nWell exposed panoramas\nA panoramic scene is almost always a high contrast scene -- you can't limit your view to areas with the same brightness when shooting a 360Ã‚Â° panorama. By taking views under several exposures and processing them in Photomatix Pro, you can create a panorama that will show details in both the dark and bright areas of the scene.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n2 GB of RAM (more recommended, the more the better)\n500 MB of available hard-disk space (more recommended)\n1,024x768 or greater monitor resolution\nColor monitor with 16-bit color or greater video card\n\nWindows platform:\n\nPhotomatix Pro: Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8 (non RT), or Windows 98, 2000 with .NET 2.0 framework or higher (if the .NET framework is not installed, the installation wizard of Photomatix Pro will invite you to download it from Microsoft's website).\nPhotomatix Essentials: Windows XP, Vista, 7 or 8.\n\nHomepage: http://www.hdrsoft.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
