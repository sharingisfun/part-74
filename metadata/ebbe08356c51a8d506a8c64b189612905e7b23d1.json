As pilots, we don't just stand on the ground ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ we fly in a variety of constantly changing weather conditions. The more we understand the forces that determine the weather around us, the better. In four action-packed volumes, one volume for each season, you can develop your own personal weather wisdom. This video series from Sporty'sÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â« Academy puts you in the cockpit for real weather flying, comparing the weather information gathered before takeoff with actual conditions encountered in flight. Your host is Richard L. Collins, author of Flying the Weather Map and Thunderstorms and Airplanes. You'll explore actual flights with him and explore their relationship to forecast weather, the weather synopsis and what was actually experienced. \n\nApprox. 1 hr and 31 minutes.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebbe08356c51a8d506a8c64b189612905e7b23d1","amp;dn":"Sportys+Spring+Weather+Flying+M4V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebbe08356c51a8d506a8c64b189612905e7b23d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,190,8,53,108,81,168,213,6,168,198,75,24,150,18,144,94,123,35,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
