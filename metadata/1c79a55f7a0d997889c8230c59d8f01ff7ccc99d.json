Desperate to right the wrong, he goes undercover, scavenging Tokyo's sweltering streets for the stray dog whose desperation has led him to a life of crime. With each step, cop and criminal's lives become more intertwined and the investigation becomes an examination of Murakami's own dark side. Starring Toshiro Mifune, as the rookie cop, and Takeshi Shimura, as the seasoned detective who keeps him on the right side of the law, Stray Dog (Nora Inu) goes beyond a crime thriller, probing the squalid world of postwar Japan and the nature of the criminal mind.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio commentary by Stephen Prince, author of The WarriorÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa\nA 32-minute documentary no Stray Dog from the series Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create, including interviews with Kurosawa, production designer Yoshiro Muraki, actress Keiko Awaji, and others\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
