The explanations are in English as well as Japanese and offer several example sentences.  The book is divided into so many weeks and with in those weeks 7 days.  Each page is a day that includes new grammar along with 7 test questions.  At the end of the week (or the 7th page of that section) you will be given a review test of the grammar you learned that week.\n\nThe Nihongo So- Matome Series makes books for every level of the JLPT and for every portion of the test:\n\nKanji\nVocabulary\nGrammar\nReading\nListening\n \n\nOverall a great tool to have help prepare you for the JLPT and learn proper Japanese.  If the practice questions were a bit more difficult  than this would be perfect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eea997159076ad1cc5401054ed30d419a26abce","amp;dn":"Nihongo+So-matome+JLPT+N3+Grammar+-+%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E7%B7%8F%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A8%E3%82%81%E3%80%80N2%E3%80%80%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eea997159076ad1cc5401054ed30d419a26abce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,234,153,113,89,7,106,209,204,84,1,5,78,211,13,65,154,38,171,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
