The band is known for clever and sometimes sarcastic lyrics, as they frequently use their songs as vehicles to lampoon perceived excesses in Western culture. Their musical style combines elements of alternative rock and Britpop, and is based around melodically powerful choruses.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - May 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303cd4d2801c867128b63ee4c8da45a059a7e3db","amp;dn":"All-Star+United+Discography+1997-2009+%286+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303cd4d2801c867128b63ee4c8da45a059a7e3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,60,212,210,128,28,134,113,40,182,62,228,200,218,69,160,89,167,227,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
