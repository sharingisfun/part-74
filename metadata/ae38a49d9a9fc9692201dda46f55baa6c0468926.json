While BrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album It All Starts With One received some acclaim, it paled in comparison with KarijordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts, which pull off the improbable feat of being both more painstakingly constructed and a good deal more accessible. However, Karijord Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who like Brun moved countries often as a child and later settled in Sweden Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has never secured much in the way of recognition outside Scandinavia. While We Become Ourselves is unlikely to reverse that trend, it nevertheless reasserts KarijordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge and growing skills an artist and will richly reward those who do spend time with this spacious and meditative record.\n\nThe last Karijord LP, The Noble Art of Letting Go, was released in the UK at the very beginning of 2011. With its lyrical focus based squarely on love and relationships, it was a frosty and sobering but heartfelt effort which found time to occasionally dip into brighter pop territory (as on the single Ã¢â‚¬ËœParking LotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢). By contrast We Become Ourselves casts its net a little more widely: while Karijord has explained that a key theme of the album is her relationships with men, Ã¢â‚¬ËœOh BrotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ makes clear that it is not just lovers being mused on but brothers, fathers and friends also. In keeping with the references to family, the big issues of life and death loom large over many of the songs, which were largely recorded in Stockholm with producer Tobias Froberg.\n\nAllied to the weighty themes at play, We Become Ourselves frequently deploys an extremely spacious mix, made possible by KarijordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to initially blow up her compositions before paring them down prior to mixing. Besides imbuing a sense of the epic to proceedings, the strategy pays off in allowing KarijordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice enormous free rein. On a number of songs but especially on opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœPrayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ she makes judicious use of melisma, the much-derided vocal technique so beloved of Mariah Carey-aping X Factor contestants. Never likely to be lumped in with that lot, Karijord makes the case to be filed alongside Stevie Wonder in the small pantheon of singers with the tact to have melisma empower rather than overwhelm their songs.\n\nWe Become Ourselves could be accused of being a little conservative in the area of instrumentation, but while thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little that is truly original about the interplay of simple percussion, strings, and guitar, it is always tasteful and considered. Ã¢â‚¬ËœUse My Body While ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Still YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more populist moments but also among its strongest, does mix things up somewhat with its tribal drums, and the choirs of men and boys make for an ideal musical counterpart to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theme.\n\nMore wide-ranging thematically but also more consistent in tone than KarijordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive last record, We Become Ourselves is a another strong statement of steady, continued development on the part of one of ScandinaviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most reliable singer-songwriters. Heady and deep without being inaccessible, it is a set of songs which reward repeated listening and one which younger challengers would be right to envy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae38a49d9a9fc9692201dda46f55baa6c0468926","amp;dn":"Rebekka+Karijord+-+We+Become+Ourselves+%5B2012%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae38a49d9a9fc9692201dda46f55baa6c0468926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,56,164,157,154,159,201,105,34,1,221,164,111,85,186,166,192,70,137,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
