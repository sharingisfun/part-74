The typical &quot;died and went to Heaven&quot; book is geared toward the Christian belief and written in the way Christians view Heaven. Anything outside of this is considered heresy; a mere hallucination. This book was considered heresy. At the end of his book, the author revealed the deception of religion stating people from all religions and from all time were there. No sugar-coating for any religion. The author subtly injected the misconceptions of concepts taught by churches concerning marriage, family, and ethnicity putting some in an uproar - a few wanting to ban his book. In efforts to counteract the snuffing out of sales from his community, the author launched a book trailer on YouTube utilizing some of the community's very words used against him, &quot;Don't be fooled.&quot; Watch the one-minute video on youtube: Man Dies, Comes Back, Slammed for Saying No Religion in Heaven.\n\n\nThese are the first 2 chapters of the controversial eBook &quot;Imagine There's a Heaven&quot;\n\nBOOK DESCRIPTION:\n\n&quot;Heaven. It's there. It's real. It's the same as on earth, but different.&quot;\n\nThese are some of the first words the sixty-one year old slowly whispered after coming out of a twelve day coma following cardiac arrest and triple-by-pass surgery.\n\nYou may have read Proof of Heaven, Heaven is for Real, To Heaven and Back and saw a glimpse of Heaven. Imagine There's a Heaven is more than a glimpse. It's an abstract, personal account of a non-churchgoing man who journeyed to Heaven - no filler, no fluff. He is a non-published author who documented his journey of what he saw, heard, felt, and did in the vast dimension of Heaven.\n\nAUTHOR: Jim Austerman\nBOOK TITLE: Imagine There's a Heaven\nFORMAT: PDF\nABRIDGED: Yes\nLANGUAGE: English\n\nAMAZON LINK: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Imagine-Theres-a-Heaven-ebook/dp/B00C54V2BK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Imagine-Theres-a-Heaven-ebook/dp/B00C54V2BK/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nRELEASE DATE: April 1, 2013\nBOOK COVER: Yes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ced8d1ace09e7c738d5c828f088e7a1fbaad02a","amp;dn":"Imagine+There%27s+a+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ced8d1ace09e7c738d5c828f088e7a1fbaad02a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,237,141,26,206,9,231,199,56,213,200,40,240,136,231,161,251,170,208,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
