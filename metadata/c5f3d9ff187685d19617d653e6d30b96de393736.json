Unzip everything to the same directory, \nthen open any of the html files in a browser. (The nofear.css file in the same\ndirectory is also used by the browser). \n\nHave fun... and please make sharing one of your life's goals. \n\nThought for the day: Copying is not Theft\n\nCopyright infringement is often called theft, but it isn't.  If a \ncopy is made of a digital file, the original is still perfectly \nworkable.  Its not really theft if the person with the first copy is \nno worse off.  On the other hand, making a copy does dilute the \nscarcity of the original file.  But why should society protect and prolong \na condition of scarcity.  In many situations, people that try to profit from \nscarcity are universally despised, such as people who hoard food during a \nfamine. Gold is scarce, but if I find a new nugget, then gold is slightly \nless scarce yet nobody says I stole the value from other holders of gold.\nThe bottom line is if technology allows easy copying, then there is no\npoint passing a law against it.  Trying to stop sharing is like trying to \nstop water from running downhill.  It's a poor use of legal resources to \nwaste time working against gravity. \n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nBeowulf\nColeridgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nDickinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nDonneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nEliotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nFrostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Early Poems\nHopkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nInferno\nKeatsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Odes\nMargaret AtwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nParadise Lost\nPilgrimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Progress\nRobert BrowningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nShakespeare's Sonnets\nShelleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nSongs of Innocence and Experience\nTennysonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nThe Canterbury Tales\nThe Faerie Queene\nThe Flowers of Evil\nThe Iliad\nThe Odyssey\nThe Rape of the Lock\nWhitmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nWordsworthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\nYeatsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poetry\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f3d9ff187685d19617d653e6d30b96de393736","amp;dn":"Poetry+Study+Guides%2C+scraped+from+sparknotes.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5f3d9ff187685d19617d653e6d30b96de393736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,243,217,255,24,118,133,209,150,23,214,83,230,211,11,150,222,57,55,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
