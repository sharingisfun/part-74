Being a punching bag for his alcoholic father has turned him into stone. Not even the dodgy trailer park he lives in can scare him. Fighting is his release and sex, drugs, and his guitar bring him peace, but deep down Zeke isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite as hard as he makes himself out to be. When he meets Patience, she finds all his broken pieces and puts him back together, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a ray of light in his shadowed life and the last thing he wants to do is bring her into his dark world. Playing careless is easy, playing the bad guy can be fun, but playing Patience is impossible, especially when she can see right through him. \n\nZeke isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broken, and for the first time, in a long time, Patience feels alive. Her black and white world gets a shot of color when she meets Zeke. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unlike anyone sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever met with his tattoos, piercings, and blunt honesty. She wants nothing more than to let go and ride the wild side with him, but some wounds never heal and the broken pieces of Patience arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so easy to find.\n\n***Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young adult readers.***\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48bdc874a5d3034b08a87ce6729bc32a562c0df","amp;dn":"Playing+Patience+by+Tabatha+Vargo+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48bdc874a5d3034b08a87ce6729bc32a562c0df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,139,220,135,74,93,48,52,176,138,135,206,103,41,188,50,165,98,192,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
