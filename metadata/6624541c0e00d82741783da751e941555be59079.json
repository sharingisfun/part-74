Construction of the units was split between three manufacturers, GEC Alsthom (Metro-Cammell) and BREL between 1991 and 1993, and ABB Rail between 1993 and 1994. Generally, the different manufacturersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ units were the same with some minor differences, which includes overhead air vents, external dot matrix displays and different traction motors.\n\nThe Networkers entered service in 1992 and were operated by British Railways until 1997, transferring to Connex, South Eastern Train and latterly to Southeastern as privatisation of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s railways developed. In total, 147 four-car trainsets were built, and can today be seen on suburban routes serving the south east of England.\n\nThe Class 465/2 for Train Simulator is available in Southeastern yellow/grey livery and features passenger view and driver reminder appliance (DRA).\n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Class 465 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the London-Faversham High Speed (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\nThe Class 465/2 is officially licensed by Southeastern.\n\n\nScenarios included with this product\n\nThree scenarios for the London-Faversham High Speed route:\nClass 465:Driver Training\nClass 465:Journey Through The Mists\nClass 465:Networker Blanket\n\n\n\n\nIncludes 2 RWP's:\n\nLondon - Faversham\nSoutheastern class 465\n\n*Install instructions*:\n\nNavigate to the railworks directory and run utilities &gt; package manager then install RWP's\n\nIts recommended you download the London - Faversham RWP even if you have it as mine disappeared after installing the 465.
