Never change a winning team. Please bear in mind that with the exception of MakeMKV and handbrake AFAIK these programs all require an internet connection to get access to a blu-ray decryption library on a remote server which is rather annoying. I've checked all files with my updated anti-virus software. If something goes wrong: sue me ;-) Some PDF help-files are included. My recommendations: For ripping use MakeMKV, for playing use VLC 2.0. Check them out. This should keep you occupied you for a while ;-) seed seed seed - seeding makes the world go round - and sharing means caring - comments are welcome - express yourself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a4183c65f256cc3d93d1a4065f7ae0c9418604","amp;dn":"Blu-ray+Playing+and+Ripping+on+Mac+OS+X+Mountain+Lion+%282nd+editi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a4183c65f256cc3d93d1a4065f7ae0c9418604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,164,24,60,101,242,86,204,61,147,209,164,6,95,122,224,201,65,134,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
