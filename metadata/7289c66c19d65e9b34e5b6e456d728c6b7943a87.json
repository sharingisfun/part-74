Jordan insists that he is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, although Amber will tell you otherwise. The duo gives off the warmth and intimacy of the likes of Johnny Cash and June Carter, with originals that are soulful and clever. In a live setting, the duo is able to quiet a large crowd with haunting, minimal instrumentation and lilting harmonies only to rile the room up again with foot-stomping, a pounding lagerphone, belly-rumbling bluesy vocals, and the occasional rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kazoo solo.\n\nWithin a few months of making music together, Shiny and the Spoon made a name for themselves in the local Cincinnati music scene. Their music has been subject to interviews with CincinnatiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CityBeat Magazine, WNKU, and ICN6TV, and LexingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Red Barn Radio. Their debut EP received rave reviews from multiple sources including AmericanaUK, Call It Folk, and FensePost.\n\nIn 2009 Shiny and the Spoon made their Midpoint Music Festival debut where they were deemed a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cincinnati Bell RingerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (reserved for Ã¢â‚¬Å“cutting edge bandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). They were also invited to showcase at CityBeatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BRINK New Music Showcase for up-and-coming local bands, and were nominated for a 2009 Cincinnati Entertainment Award for New Artist of the Year.\n\nNash and Neff continue to draw larger and larger crowds at their local shows and are frequently described in print as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“local favorite,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“band to watch.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not uncommon to see the crowd singing along to their favorite songs and calling out for more of those rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kazoo solos.\n\nThe duo recently became a trio with the addition of Mark Utley (of Magnolia Mountain) on upright bass.\n\nShiny and the Spoon released their debut EP to a packed house in January of 2010 and are currently working on their first full-length album set to come out in late summer 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7289c66c19d65e9b34e5b6e456d728c6b7943a87","amp;dn":"Shiny+and+the+Spoon+-+Ferris+Wheel+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7289c66c19d65e9b34e5b6e456d728c6b7943a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,137,198,108,25,214,94,155,52,229,182,228,86,215,40,198,183,148,58,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
