GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.

If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!
