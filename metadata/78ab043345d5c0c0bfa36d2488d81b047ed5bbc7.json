Since their formation in 2000 they have released 8 records of which 3 are acoustic albums.\n\nThe band was formed in autumn'2000.\n\nMusic of Animal Jazz is hard guitar, based on romantic harmonies. It also tends to sound symphonicaly. The name of the group reflects it's essential - it's correctly eclectic. The word animal shows that music is of natural origin. In fact, one of the definitions of the word jazz is vanity, chaos. Such cocktail of styles mixed with animal energetic makes the original sound of Animal Jazz.\n\nThe band was nominated twice on Fuzz Magazine Awards and played the sets at both ceremonies: in 2003 as Best New Band&quot; and in 2004 as &quot;Best Live Band.\n\nIn August 2006 the Animal Jazz band was headlining the alternative stage of the biggest Russian open-air rock festival Nashestvie.\n\nAnimal Jazz was nominated in few categories for RAMP 2008 (Rock Alternative Music Prize) and was a winner in Best song of the year and Soundtrack of the year.\n\nDuring winter 2008-2009 the band was making the recording of their new LP at the several St. Petersburg studios.
