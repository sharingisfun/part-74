When she found out that her fiance's parents didn't approve of her impending marriage, she murdered them in cold blood. As they were dying, they managed to tell their son who had done the deed.\n\nNaturally, the fiance wasn't too terribly happy to hear that, and he wound up killing Tyra. The murderess went to hell, where she became a loyal servant to Satan himself. Her job was to seduce men into losing their souls.\n\nMadam Satan was very straight-forward with her plans at first, but after two issues, she tried subterfuge, which worked pretty well until Brother Sunbeam showed up. This enigmatic figure was able to thwart her at every turn. Brother Sunbeam tried to capture her into a bottle, but never could.\n\nHer powers included hypnotic power over men and the ability to kill with a kiss.\n\nHistorical Notes \n\nMadame Satan had the dubious distinction of having her feature canceled to make room for a teen humor strip that starred a certain Archie Andrews (MLJ/Archie Comics fame). Because she was a fairly dark character, she was one of the few Golden Age characters Archie Comics tries its best not to acknowledge (the other being Mr. Satan). \n\nseed so all will enjoy! sharing is caring!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74fe038b7bd30f8ece14f28f63c17b363fd34df","amp;dn":"Madam+Satan+Collection++MLJ++1941+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74fe038b7bd30f8ece14f28f63c17b363fd34df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,79,224,56,183,189,48,248,236,225,79,40,246,60,23,179,99,253,52,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
