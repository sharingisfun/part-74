This is the best quality one i could find on the web, i'm sorry that it's not HD.\n\nPlease seed to keep this great episode going!\n\n\nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempt to see if it is cheaper to buy a car for exploring the southern part of the United States for a week rather than renting one. Upon their arrival in Miami, the three were given US$1000 to buy a used car. Over the next several hours they discovered that there were very few usable American cars available at that price. Eventually, Clarkson bought a 1991 Chevrolet Camaro RS; Hammond a 1991 Dodge Ram 150 pickup truck; and May a 1989 Cadillac Brougham. The overall challenge would be to drive from Miami to New Orleans; at the end of this trip the cars would be sold to see which presenter could make the most money back. En route to their first challenge, the presenters discussed the foibles of their respective cars. It was soon discovered that May's Cadillac was the only one with working air conditioning, a point greatly appreciated in the Florida heat.\n\nIt is the one where he has a Cow on the roof lol :)\n\n\nWikipedia page on this episode - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear:_US_Special\n\n\nThanks and be sure to seed :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e78937b48012d199d777b345c0dadde1b3de66","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+-+S09E03+-+US+SPECIAL+-+USA+SPECIAL+-+RARE+TORRENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e78937b48012d199d777b345c0dadde1b3de66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,231,137,55,180,128,18,209,153,215,119,179,69,192,218,221,225,179,222,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
