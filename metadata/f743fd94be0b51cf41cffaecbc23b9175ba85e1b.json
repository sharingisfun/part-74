The hussars, mostly ordinary men, have heard news of the uprising and wish to return to the homeland to defend the newly independent country. The Empire, on the other hand, is firmly resolved that all Hungarian troops in the imperial army should be kept as far away from the trouble spot as possible, knowing that most soldiers would be loyal to Budapest rather than Vienna.\n\nReview:\n\nWhat can I say. This movie is the best I have seen about the Hungarian revolution in 1848-49. So beautiful, so tragic, and so historically true. I can suggest it to anyone. A movie,being shot in the most exquisite regions of the Carpathians. The story is very thrilling and eventful.Actors are very good.This is a story about courage,patriotism(even if it costs to one's life),endurance,self-sacrifice,revolution against tyranny,the love of freedom. Believe me, if you have the opportunity, view it! And the greatest idea in it: when the last scene is over,there is a 3-4 minute blank black screen...a little time for thinking. And it is necessary.\n\nPLEASE NOTE, THIS IS A TV-RIP, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS THE BEST VIDEO AVAILABLE ON THE NET AT THE MOMENT.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet, pretorians.net, feliratok.info \nGroup/Ripper: ThanxXx pretorians.net for the rip!
