The Lawof a Pure Heart \n\n&quot;Let us draw near ... having our heartssprinkled from an  evil\nconscience...&quot; (HEB 10:22). God's first condition is that my heart \nmust be pure. &quot;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lordwill \nnot hear me&quot; (PSA 66:18).\n\n\n2. The Lawof a Forgiving Spirit \n\n&quot;And when ye stand  praying, forgive, ifye have ought against\nany...&quot;  (MK 11:25).  This is a condition for getting your \nprayers answered.\n\n\n\n3. The Lawof the Right Motive\n\n&quot;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye  ask  amiss, thatye may \nconsume it upon your lusts.&quot; (JAM 4:3)\n\n\n\n4. The Lawof Faith \n&quot;Let him askin  faith,  nothing wavering...&quot;  (JAM 1:6). Weymouth translates this as: &quot;Let him... have no doubts.&quot;Faith is indispensable if we want  to \nreceive answers to our prayers, for &quot;without faith it is impossible \ntoplease him.&quot; (HEB 11:6). However, when there is faith, God \nworks miracles\n\n\n\n5. PrayAccording to the Will of \nGod \n\n&quot;If weask any thing according tohis will, he heareth us&quot;  (1.JN \n5:14). Everything depends on this. First we have to find out \nGod's will, and we have to pray according to His will. Without \nknowing God's will it is impossible to have faith that moves \nmountains.\n\n\n\n6. Praying in the Name of Jesus \n\nJesus said:  &quot;If ye shallask anything in my name, I will do\nit.&quot; (JN 14:14). What a promise! \nBut what does it mean, to ask in  the Name ofJesus? \nSomething much deeper than some people think. It is not a \nmatter of quoting a formula. \nThis cannot achieve a result. A formula can be on our lips, but \nhave no meaning whatsoever.\n\n\n\n7. Praying in the HolySpirit \n\n&quot;Prayingin the  Holy  Ghost&quot;(JUDE 20)is the secret of every \nvictorious  prayer. It is impossible to ask in faith if we \nare not controlled and inspired by the Holy Ghost. The Holy \nSpirit is the only one who can give faith; He is the only one \nwho knows what Jesus wants, the  only one who can reveal \nthe will of God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cec64bca93de18419307cf231281a362a621f4","amp;dn":"Seven+Laws+of+Prayer+in+8+languages++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cec64bca93de18419307cf231281a362a621f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,206,198,75,202,147,222,24,65,147,7,207,35,18,129,163,98,166,33,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
