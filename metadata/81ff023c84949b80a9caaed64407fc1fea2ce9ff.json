While the fair is in Altamont NY, Glanton goes to visit an ex-lover, Romina, and learns that he is the father of her son. Glanton quits his job as a stuntman to stay in town and provide for his child, but Romina does not want him in the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, as she has become involved in a relationship with another man, Kofi.\n\nGlanton turns to Robin, an auto repair shop owner, for part-time employment as he continuously attempts to insert himself into his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Making only minimum wage, Glanton asks Robin for more money to care for his son. Robin reveals that he was once a bank robber, and offers to partner with Glanton to hit several banks in the area. The duo perform several successful heists, in which Glanton performs the robbery, then uses his motorbike as a getaway vehicle and drives it into an unmarked truck driven by Robin. Glanton uses the new money to win back RominaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust and visits her and his son more often. RominaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new partner, Kofi, objects to his presence, and the two have an altercation at KofiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house which results in GlantonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrest for assault after he hits Kofi in the head with a wrench.\n\nAfter Robin has bailed him out of jail, Glanton immediately wants to resume their bank robberies. Robin objects, not wanting to press their luck, and the two have a falling-out that results in Robin dismantling the motorbike and Glanton taking back the bail money he owed Robin at gunpoint. Glanton attempts to rob a bank alone, and is pursued by police. He falls off his bike during the chase and seeks refuge in a residentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home, where he is pursued by Officer Avery Cross. Glanton, sensing defeat, corners himself upstairs and calls Romina. Just before Cross confronts him, Glanton asks Romina not to tell their child about who he was. Cross enters the room and fires the first shot; Glanton falls out the second-story window after shooting Cross in the leg. Cross looks out the window to find Glanton dead on the pavement.\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ff023c84949b80a9caaed64407fc1fea2ce9ff","amp;dn":"The+Place+Beyond+The+Pines.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ff023c84949b80a9caaed64407fc1fea2ce9ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,255,2,60,132,148,155,128,169,202,174,214,68,7,252,31,234,44,233,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
