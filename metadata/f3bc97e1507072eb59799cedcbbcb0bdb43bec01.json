Despite its strange, silly premise, it does have a few explicitly gory sequences--some zombies turn into sloppy messes when shot down. But if you like action-packed games or horror movies, you'll probably enjoy The Typing of the Dead...and even if you don't, you might want to give it a try.\n\nIt also teaches you to type faster! :D Ported by myself using wineskin.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: When you open the game choose No to the first question and Yes to the second in order for the game to run properly.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3bc97e1507072eb59799cedcbbcb0bdb43bec01","amp;dn":"The+Typing+of+the+Dead+%28Mac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3bc97e1507072eb59799cedcbbcb0bdb43bec01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,188,151,225,80,112,114,235,89,121,156,237,203,188,176,189,180,59,236,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
