But when his deployment ended, so did the letters. Ever since that day, Grace has been coasting, academically and emotionally. The one thing sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decided? No way is Noah Jackson Ã¢â‚¬â€ or any man Ã¢â‚¬â€ ever going to break her heart again.\n\nNoah has always known exactly what he wants out of life. Success. Stability. Control. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why he joined the Marines and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fighting his way Ã¢â‚¬â€ literally Ã¢â‚¬â€ through college. Now that heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got the rest of his life on track, he has one last conquest: Grace Sullivan. But since he was the one who stopped writing, he knows that winning her back will be his biggest battle yet.\n\nThis is a mature New Adult book. I see that it is classified as YA - not sure how to change that - but I wanted to be clear that it has explicit love scenes in the story.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdbbc7fecc7a0478dde7700e0984d1ae0373b1ec","amp;dn":"Undeclared+%28Woodlands+%231%29+by+Jen+Frederick+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdbbc7fecc7a0478dde7700e0984d1ae0373b1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,187,199,254,204,122,4,120,221,231,112,14,9,132,209,174,3,115,177,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
