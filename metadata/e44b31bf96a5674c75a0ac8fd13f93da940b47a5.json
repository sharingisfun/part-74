For this &quot;remaster&quot; or optimization, I did not aim for preserving the authentic original sound, so purists might be disappointed. Instead I tried to get as full sounding a result as I could. \n\nI spent alot of time playing around with this, and used alot of tricks and things to achieve the result I wanted. Some may be happy to know there are no compressors used at all, and the final volume is quite reserved.\nThe biggest change is that the high end is now alot more lively and present. The original was very muffled and weighted towards the mid-frequencies. This also hid some of the mixing inconsistencies, &quot;Medusa&quot; is by far the best mixed track on the album when it comes to kick and snare drum in my opinion, and the other songs fall more or less behind it.\nOverall the sound is now more even in tonality across the spectrum, and more refined in sound. I also tried to bring out the percussive elements in the mix, the original sound is quite flat when it comes to transients.\n\nThe result should hopefully also be playable at higher volumes without anything jumping out and annoying your ears too much.\n\n\n\nI hope this might be of benefit to someone, and do give me your comments and criticism if you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44b31bf96a5674c75a0ac8fd13f93da940b47a5","amp;dn":"Anthrax+-+Spreading+The+Disease+1985+%28Fan+Remaster%2FOptimized%29+%28F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44b31bf96a5674c75a0ac8fd13f93da940b47a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,75,49,191,150,165,103,76,117,160,172,143,209,63,147,218,148,11,71,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
