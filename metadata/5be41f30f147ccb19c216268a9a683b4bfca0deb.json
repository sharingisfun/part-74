It is in a compiled html help file.\n\nEnclosed is various worksheets and power points on an introductory course to electronics. It may be useful for anyone studying eletronics or students whom are interested in this field.\n\nI myself find the curriculum alright, but you can probably use this as an starting point to look up new information.\n\n\nIf you are truly interested in how computers work from boolean gates to programming i suggest checking out the book CODE by Charles Petzold.\n\nIf this file torrent doesn't work comment below. \n\nGood luck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5be41f30f147ccb19c216268a9a683b4bfca0deb","amp;dn":"PLTW+DE+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5be41f30f147ccb19c216268a9a683b4bfca0deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,228,31,48,241,71,204,177,156,33,98,104,169,166,131,180,191,202,13,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
