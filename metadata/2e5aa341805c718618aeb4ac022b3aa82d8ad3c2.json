Yet, thanks to a simple and straightforward approach to the recording process, Brothers and Sisters is full of buzzing, open-chord goodness, crackling harmonies and visceral energy to spare. \n\n&quot;What Wynn and the Believers deliver is a sly bit of surprise. Their workmanlike ethos and general ubiquity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seldom a week goes by without a gig of some sort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has likely lulled local scene-watchers into thinking they know exactly what the deal is here: classic rock delivered with roof-raising spirit and a crowd-friendly smile. But there are also subtle variations on the 40-year-old form, tweaks that are much more recognizable on record than on stage. \n\n&quot;For instance, the title track unfolds gradually and gracefully into a CCR-quoting number that seems like an awfully unoriginal way to begin a record. However, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brothers and SistersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reveals itself as much more complex, using a Fogerty riff as little more than a launchpad for a soulful, cathartic and completely original rocker. \n\n&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that soulfulness that continues to set WynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band apart from many road-dogging young classic-rock acts. Live, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the grit in WynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice, the generosity of his spirit and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visible camaraderie that helps to elevate the BelieversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music beyond mundane recitations of worn-out Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s rock tropes. On the album, thanks to the live-to-tape ethos of the sessions, all of that comes across beautifully.&quot; Jason Ferguson/Orlando Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5aa341805c718618aeb4ac022b3aa82d8ad3c2","amp;dn":"Thomas+Wynn+and+The+Believers+-+Brothers+and+Sisters+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5aa341805c718618aeb4ac022b3aa82d8ad3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,90,163,65,128,92,113,134,24,174,180,172,2,43,58,168,45,138,211,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
