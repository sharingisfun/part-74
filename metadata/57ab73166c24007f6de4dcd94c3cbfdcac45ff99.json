Running the gamut from romantic melodramas to political thrillers to screwball comedies to fantasy horror, his movies capture the ever shifting landscape of 20th century Cambodia. This first volume includes seven of his most famous works:\n\nApsara\nThe Rose of Bokor\nShadow Over Angkor\nLa Joie de Vivre\nTwilight\nSee Angkor and Die\nThe Last Days of Colonel Savath\n\nMost of these films (with the exception of Apsara) are ripped from low-quality VHS transfers, and the English subtitles are barely legible for some, but these films are of historic importance to both cinephiles and historians.\n\nAs always please seed at least what you take so that this torrent will live forever, thank you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ab73166c24007f6de4dcd94c3cbfdcac45ff99","amp;dn":"The+Films+of+HM+Norodom+Sihanouk+Volume+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ab73166c24007f6de4dcd94c3cbfdcac45ff99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,171,115,22,108,36,0,127,109,228,220,217,76,60,191,220,172,69,255,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
