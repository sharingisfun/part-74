I knew at once what it was. A pistol. Resting on the bone just behind my ear. The favorite place for murderers, robbers, highwaymen Ã¢â‚¬â€ because, by angling the pistol slightly inward, they could be sure to blow a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brains out before he might have time to scream.&quot;\n\nInspired by &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; the famous poem by Alfred Noyes, this dramatic and moving historical adventure is set on the stark, ghostly moors that seem as menacing as the pursuing redcoats. A thrilling adventure featuring a feisty heroine, a rebellious young man, and a galloping, heart-clutching story.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Highwayman's Curse\nOn the run from the redcoats, the two young highwaymen, Will and Bess, find themselves in Galloway, Scotland, blamed for a murder they did not commit. Here, they are captured by smugglers and become embroiled in a story of hatred and revenge that goes back for generations, to the days of the Killing Times. Whose side will they take? Can anything they do end the cycle of religious hatred? And will their own friendship survive?\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nNicola Morgan, a former teacher and literacy specialist, is the author of several critically acclaimed novels. She lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.  Please check your Bit-Torrent client for the true number of seeds.
