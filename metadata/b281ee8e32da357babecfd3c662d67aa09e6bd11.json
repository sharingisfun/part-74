Byzantium Linux is designed to run on any x86 computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless interface.  Byzantium can be burned to optical disk (the .iso image is around 330 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system without risk to the user's data and software.  Byzantium Linux will create a mesh node, automatically configure itself, and then connect to other mesh nodes where it acts as an access point for wifi-enabled devices.\n\nThis release builds upon the advances made in previous releases and adds much-requested support for Intel-based Macbooks.\n\nFor more information, please visit our homepage at &lt;a href=&quot;http://project-byzantium.org/&quot;&gt;http://project-byzantium.org/&lt;/a&gt;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b281ee8e32da357babecfd3c662d67aa09e6bd11","amp;dn":"Byzantium+Linux+v0.3.2a+%28Taxi+Cat%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b281ee8e32da357babecfd3c662d67aa09e6bd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,129,238,142,50,218,53,123,171,236,253,60,102,45,103,170,9,230,189,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
