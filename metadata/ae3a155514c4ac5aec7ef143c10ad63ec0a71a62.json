Gene Hackman plays the brilliant leader of a gang (Delroy Lindo, Ricky Jay &amp; Rebecca Pigeon as Hackman's youngish wife), which pulls off complex heists for a despicable fence (Danny DeVito). After stiffing the gang on a jewelry robbery, DeVito forces the gang to go after a Swiss gold shipment and to use his nephew (Sam Rockwell) in the crime. No one trusts anyone and every step is shaded with the unexpected. (Summary Written by John Sacksteder)\n\n- - - \n\nThis is from the Bingowingz torrent, where the audio was badly out of sync.\n\nI went and fixed that, because it had the best picture quality of the torrents in this size range.\n\nIn the original release it's the blue copyright insert at the beginning that fucks up the audio sync, causing a shift of 7 to 8 seconds.\n\nI fixed that, exported the audio again as 5.1 at a higher bitrate -448- to compensate for the recompression, then muxed with the video untouched.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae3a155514c4ac5aec7ef143c10ad63ec0a71a62","amp;dn":"Heist.%5B2001%5DDVDRip.H264.audio.shift.fixed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae3a155514c4ac5aec7ef143c10ad63ec0a71a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,58,21,85,20,196,172,90,236,126,241,67,193,10,214,62,192,167,26,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
