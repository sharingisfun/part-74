Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6fe9fa1035293a714b6c1a1e6052c38ebb3df6","amp;dn":"Leader+of+German+Solar+Revolution+-+Hermann+Sheer+-+Interviews","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6fe9fa1035293a714b6c1a1e6052c38ebb3df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,111,233,250,16,53,41,58,113,75,108,26,30,96,82,195,142,187,61,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
