This program on flying WAAS approaches with the Garmin 430W/530W gives pilots the knowledge needed to fly these new instrument approaches with confidence. In this program, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll examine the redesigned RNAV (GPS) approach charts. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the specifics of LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches and see how they provide ILS-like guidance when using the Garmin 430W, one of the most popular panel-mount units. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ride along on three flights to see, step-by-step, how to set-up and fly three different GPS approaches including an LPV approach. Learn how the unit provides turn-by-turn guidance for flying procedure turns and holding patterns and how the 430W uses WAAS information to provide an electronic glidepath and more accurate navigation guidance. \n\nApprox. 20 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0992a65bcca5b93c66f74d8327ad6ceaca1d461","amp;dn":"WAAS+Approaches%3A+Garmin+430W%2F530W+M4V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0992a65bcca5b93c66f74d8327ad6ceaca1d461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,153,42,101,188,202,91,147,198,111,116,216,50,122,214,206,172,161,212,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
