Poor Don Juan falls in love with the girl, however, while his servant Pablo (Sture Lagerwall) attempts to do the same with her mother. One of Bergman's few direct comedies (he even reassures viewers of the fact in a note titled &quot;Dear Frightened Audience&quot;), Devil's Eye also harks back to his stage experience by appearing in separate acts--with introductions by Gunnar Bjornstrand. \n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25690fa1567d3e5cf17c758e214d2205bdee10b","amp;dn":"Djavulens+Oga+aka+The+Devil+s+Eye+1960+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25690fa1567d3e5cf17c758e214d2205bdee10b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,86,144,250,21,103,211,229,207,23,199,88,226,20,210,32,91,222,225,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
