The books were LaHaye's brainchild, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, did the actual writing of the books from LaHaye's notes.[10] LaHaye has said, &quot;I write the best I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis. The literary-type writers, I admire them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041d25b0d483029ed185d5a6b6aeaac5cfe6de80","amp;dn":"Tim+LaHaye+and+Jerry+B+Jenkins+-+Revelation+Rapture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041d25b0d483029ed185d5a6b6aeaac5cfe6de80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,29,37,176,212,131,2,158,209,133,213,166,182,174,170,197,207,230,222,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
