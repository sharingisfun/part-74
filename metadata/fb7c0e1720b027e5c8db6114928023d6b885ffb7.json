When his lover dumps him for another man, Paul is forced to rethink his life. He visits his childhood home in rural Pennsylvania rather than spend the holidays alone in San Francisco. But only a few days with his family is enough to convince him that you can't go home again.\n\nPaul leaves for the airport in the midst of a snowstorm. Stranded in the woodlands, a chance meeting between him and a hunter is his only option for survival. He knows the type. A backwoods bigot like the men he grew up with. But what choice does he have? A few days with the Mountain Man convinces Paul there's more to Andy Reynolds than meets the eye. But is it enough to bind two men who have nothing in common except their sex?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7c0e1720b027e5c8db6114928023d6b885ffb7","amp;dn":"Silent+Knights+by+Gale+Stanley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7c0e1720b027e5c8db6114928023d6b885ffb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,124,14,23,32,176,39,229,200,219,97,20,146,128,35,214,184,133,255,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
