It explores what is meant by the term 'computer misuse' and charts its emergence as a problem as well as its expansion in parallel with the continued progression in computing power, networking, reach and accessibility. In doing so, it surveys the attempts of the domestic criminal law to deal with some early manifestations of computer misuse and the consequent legislative passage of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.\n\nThis book will be of interest to students of IT law as well as to sociologists and criminologists, and those who have a professional concern with preventing computer misuse and fraud.\n\n\nInformation:\n------------\nAuthor: Stefan Fafinski\nPublication Date: 1 April 2009\nISBN-10: 1843923793\nISBN-13: 978-1843923794\n\nPDF\nEnglish\n357 pages\n1.76 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48f36145fc774ee5ea392d3907d281318f17cc75","amp;dn":"Computer+Misuse+Act","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48f36145fc774ee5ea392d3907d281318f17cc75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,243,97,69,252,119,78,229,234,57,45,57,7,210,129,49,143,23,204,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
