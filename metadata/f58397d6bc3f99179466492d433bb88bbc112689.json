As such, the book analyses selected topics of quantum optics, focusing on atom-field interactions from a group-theoretical perspective, while discussing the principal quantum optics models using algebraic language. The overall result is a clear demonstration of the advantages of applying algebraic methods to quantum optics problems, illustrated by a number of end-of-chapter problems.\nAn invaluable source for atomic physicists, graduates and students in physics.
