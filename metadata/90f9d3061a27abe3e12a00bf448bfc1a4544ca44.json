Nastos &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/continuation-mw0000810327&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/continuation-mw0000810327&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlex Cline's percussion armada of drums, cymbals, and little instruments has\nlikely not been showcased as well as on Continuation, a set of free based,\ncontemplative, and harmonically rich works made for his heroes, mentors, and\nrecently deceased friends. Between what Cline is able to conjure from several\ndifferent sonic aspects, his able bandmates give full account of themselves in\ntheir attempt to fully fashion his music in percussive and melodic means. The\nalways exceptional individualist Myra Melford, though playing string-based or\nsounding instruments in the piano and harmonium, has a seemingly separate role,\nforcefully willing her way into advancing the compositions more rhythmically\nthan Cline. Cellist Peggy Lee, violinist Jeff Gauthier, and bassist Scott\nWalton all have similar stances in bowing their instruments to soaring heights,\nbut make a more melancholic music that speaks directly to the art of\ncontinuation, and how it manifests renewed life. What is most noticeable is the\ninsular restlessness of the group in that they steer clear of clichÃƒÂ©s, straight\ntime, or thematic motifs, moving on to the next-next phase with\nregularity. Exploring a full range of improvised sounds and specific ideas is\nmore important than the tunefulness of each composition. This tone is set on\nthe opener &quot;Nourishing Our Roots&quot; as Cline's unique technique on gongs aside\nLee's free time cello establishes a lovely, low key meditative mood. Closer to\nterra firma, &quot;Clearing Our Streams&quot; swings and grooves after a deft solo by\nWalton and gliding harmonium plus violin lines, then the band goes into a\nharder edged jam. &quot;Fade to Green&quot; is an epilogue for Cline's deceased friend\nDan Morris, a spare piece full of regret, moaning, and at times macabre\nremembrances with many clattering inserts by the percussionist. The best and\nmost accessible track, &quot;Steadfast,&quot; starts with a drum solo cued into Melford's\ncascading or forceful piano, then a 7/8 ostinato is established setting up\ntuneful melody refrains which supply the most jazz content within a modal\ncontext. Two eighteen-and-a-half minute tracks really stretch a listener's\nattention span, but are worth the time spent. &quot;SubMerge&quot; is dedicated to\nJapanese dancers Eiko &amp; Kono, a very underground interpretive piece as Cline's\narsenal of tiny sounds is fully utilized, while Melford's harmonium and bowed\nstrings sing. &quot;On the Bones of the Homegoing Thunder&quot; is dedicated to Thomas\nMerton, featuring sour off-key notes busting out into Melford's driving hard\nbop, decomposed to nothing, then roaring with Cline's drum kit pounding and\ndancing figures. As to whether this is a logical end game or only the beginning\nof how Cline expands his vocabulary is sheer conjecture, but if it were deemed\na magnum opus, it would result in a championship. Continuation is a fully\nrealized artistic statement, highly recommended to those who are open to all\naspects of future musical visions.\n\n--\n\nBy John Kelman &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31736&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31736&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Will Layman &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/71104-alex-cline-continuation-nels-cline-coward/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/71104-alex-cline-continuation-nels-cline-coward/&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/03/04/alex-cline-continuation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/03/04/alex-cline-continuation/&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Ãƒï¿½ngel GÃƒÂ³mez Aparicio (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuadernosdejazz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuadernosdejazz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f9d3061a27abe3e12a00bf448bfc1a4544ca44","amp;dn":"Alex+Cline+-+Continuation+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f9d3061a27abe3e12a00bf448bfc1a4544ca44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,249,211,6,26,39,171,227,225,42,0,191,68,139,252,26,69,68,202,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
