You can set a custom font and color, adjust opacity level and transparency, and insert special characters like Ã‚Â© and Ã‚Â®. The watermark can be placed anywhere on the image, using customizable presets or exact x/y positioning.\n\nuMark supports multiple image formats and lets you convert your images from one format to the other. With uMark you can also rotate and tile your watermarks.
