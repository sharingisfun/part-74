He expected HR to hire someone older, more experienced, maybe even with gray hair. Who he got instead was the beautiful, young, single mother - Claire Russell. A woman who he is having a hard time keeping his eyes off of...\n\nClaire never expected her new boss to be the most gorgeous man she's ever laid eyes on. She also never expected him to be sweet to her two year old son, Ethan. But Henry is her boss and there is no future with him. Or so Claire thinks...\n\nWill Henry and Claire be able to fight the obvious attraction between them? Will Henry's overbearing mother come between them? Or will a freak accident change their perspectives on life and what's most important...\n\nBook 2: Sebastian (The Beck Brothers #2) by Andria Large (April 19th 2013)\n\nAfter his wife cheated on him and then asked for a divorce, Sebastian Beck was devastated. The solution? Never let another woman get close enough to hurt him. His mind was made up. He would never fall in love again. And he most certainly would never get married again. Except, he never expected the one night that he was forced to protect his nephews with deadly force to bring him back in contact with the one woman he thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never see again. \n\nWhen Detective Raelynn Reynolds bent some hot guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finger back in a bar a little over a year ago, she never thought sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d see him again. Honestly...she never expected to see him ever again. She definitely never expected to see him at the scene of a break-in that had a dead body just inside the back door. \n\nAs Sebastian and RaelynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives become more intertwined with each passing day, can Sebastian get over his fear of love to keep the one woman who makes him insanely happy? Will Sebastian be able to get over his fear before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late? Before he could possibly lose Raelynn forever? Could fate really be that cruel?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d0f2d1cc4a425f73e6cc430bafa104c9788385","amp;dn":"The+Beck+Brother+Series+%281-2%29+by+Andria+Large+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d0f2d1cc4a425f73e6cc430bafa104c9788385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,208,242,209,204,74,66,95,115,230,204,67,11,175,161,4,201,120,131,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
