Much to the displeasure of his sister. \n\nCreators:\n David Kohan, Max Mutchnick \n\nStars:\n Anthony Clark, Hedy Burress, Traylor Howard\n\nAll episodes except Season 1 Ep. 10 \n\nThe quality is pretty bad. I'd say vhs but it's all I could find. The file size is rather large for a half hour show. Season 2 has 23 episodes but on episodeguide.com it says it should only have 22. \n \nI wish the quality was better but it's all I could find. I've been looking for this forever but couldn't find it anywhere. Not on dvd or vhs or anything. So I figured better this than nothing. If you find better copies let me know. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af10377738a44656b9813b8879d44ebf4b0cb5c6","amp;dn":"Boston+Common+Season+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af10377738a44656b9813b8879d44ebf4b0cb5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,16,55,119,56,164,70,86,185,129,59,136,121,212,78,191,75,12,181,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
