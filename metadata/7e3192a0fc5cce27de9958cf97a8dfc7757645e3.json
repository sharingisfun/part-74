Her voice often drew comparisons to Janis Joplin, but Rumpf was able to develop her own unique vocal style. Catapulted to stardom in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s with her band Frumpy, she released a number of highly acclaimed solo works in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s and came to be regarded as the grand old lady of German R&amp;B. Whereas other German female vocalists such as Nina Hagen faded away over time, Rumpf consequently followed her path and never compromised herself artistically (unlike her ex-bandmate Udo Lindenberg, whose creativity died down by the end of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s when he started putting out lightweight pop). (AllMusic)\n&quot;..... and recordings with Inga and the NDR Big Band followed. And then, year 1988 saw the first live concerts in Stade and Wolfsburg. More and more gigs followed, inter alia in 1993 a tour of northern and eastern states of Germany. This CD provides a summary of these joint ventures.\nNDR Big Band is an orchestra with a particular profile:\nNo other band has worked with so many great soloists, none ever dived as deep into as many different styles. Very difficult to single out a single collaboration, one highlight follows another, perhaps 'superceeded' only by those two famous performances with jazz giant Chet Baker in 1987 and 1988 which became true legend.&quot; (liner notes)\n\nTrack list:\n01.
