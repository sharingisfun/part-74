Elminster soon inhabits the body of a fallen dark elf, so that he can begin carrying out Mystra's orders to rally Cormyr's Wizards of War, seek blueflame items to mend immense rifts throughout the realms that are releasing deadly monsters, and prevent the ancient Primordials from rising and unleashing their rage. But his sworn archenemy, Manshoon, has plans as well: to conquer Cormyr and be the new Emperor, and hunt down the Sage's clones. The battles are fierce, the stakes have never been higher, and the fate of Cormyr is on the line. Meanwhile, War Wizards are being mysteriously assassinated . . . \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea43196b18dd61d6d2e5eec2ea3bae483f89d333","amp;dn":"Elminster+Enraged+%28Forgotten+Realms+%234%29+by+Ed+Greenwood+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea43196b18dd61d6d2e5eec2ea3bae483f89d333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,67,25,107,24,221,97,214,210,229,238,194,234,59,174,72,63,137,211,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
