Raynal stars in the film, her first as a director; she had previously worked for several years as a film editor, most notably for films in Ãƒâ€°ric Rohmer's &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot; series. The film's title, which literally translates as Twice and is sometimes translated into English as Twice Upon a Time, refers to the occasional repetition of scenes or actions.\n\nDeux fois is one of the most notable of the Zanzibar Films, a group of feature-length experimental work made from 1968 to 1970 with the financing of Sylvina Boissonnas. It is also considered a landmark of Feminist filmmaking. Raynal shot the film in nine days in Barcelona, Spain, casting a man she had met there, Francisco Viader, as one of the leads.\n\nRegarding the film, the influential French critic Serge Daney wrote: &quot;She put in her film the visionary crazed coldness of major paranoiacs. We also find the murderous, painful madness of Fritz Lang's great films, in which all the fiction is reduced to sketchy outlines, arabesques, leaving almost no trace.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Deux Fois (1968).mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 048 Kbps\nLength            : 948 MiB for 1h 4mn 40s 920ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 652 x 576 anamorfic (1.609) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : de\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #4           : VobSub\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294525/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0294525/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French and Spanish\nSubtitles: French, English, German, Spanish, Italians and Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip\n\nJackie Raynal -  Deux fois (1968) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4199813b70484970330ca003a845996f6877368","amp;dn":"Jackie+Raynal+-++Deux+fois+%281968%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4199813b70484970330ca003a845996f6877368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,25,152,19,183,4,132,151,3,48,202,0,58,132,89,150,246,135,115,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
