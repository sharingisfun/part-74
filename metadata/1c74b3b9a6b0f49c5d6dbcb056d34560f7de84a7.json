Keywords that describe this album best are Ã¢â‚¬ËœaddictiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœmeaningfulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœheartfeltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœmellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Standout tracks are Ã¢â‚¬ËœHappiness and Good IntentionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAvalancheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; simply beautiful and I defy anyone into this genre of music not to be moved.\nFor best results Jay Leighton is best served up loud on headphones, late at night.\n\nJay Leighton began his music career in 2008 with a major label deal for his band Buffalo Ã¢â‚¬â„¢77. The trio, fronted by Jay, quickly gained momentum and signed to Island Records, only to part ways with the label and split as a band before their debut album could be released. Disillusioned with the music industry and all it had to offer, Jay considered quitting music altogether, but soon found himself back in the studio recording solo mini-album Ã¢â‚¬ËœPolaroids &amp; StillsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Following festivals and live shows all over the world, including dates with cult band Lamb. Jay released his full-length debut (Ã¢â‚¬ËœAs the Sun Comes UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) in spring 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c74b3b9a6b0f49c5d6dbcb056d34560f7de84a7","amp;dn":"Jay+Leighton+-+As+The+Sun+Comes+Up+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c74b3b9a6b0f49c5d6dbcb056d34560f7de84a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,116,179,185,166,176,244,156,93,109,188,176,86,211,69,96,247,222,132,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
