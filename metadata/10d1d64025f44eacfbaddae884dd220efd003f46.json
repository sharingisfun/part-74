Morning In A Bar\n10. Sleep Forever\n\nMore B.S., the latest release from Philly-born songwriter Bree Sharp, includes plenty of the acerbic social commentary that propelled her quirky breakout hit, &quot;David Duchovny.&quot; Sharp, whose distinct warble occasionally sounds like a funkier, smarter (and less drugged-out) Belinda Carlisle fronting Ani DiFrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band, offers nothing as immediately radio-ready as &quot;David Duchovny&quot; on this turn, but what she does have is much better than novelty: a collection of songs inviting and rewarding reflection.\n\nSharpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tilt-of-the-head is certainly twisted. In &quot;Dirty Magazine&quot; she gleefullyÃ¢â‚¬â€and unapologeticallyÃ¢â‚¬â€constructs a narrative about a 13-year-old runaway who dreams of being pimped out in porn. Much like &quot;America&quot; off her 1999 debut, A Cheap and Evil Girl, &quot;Lazy Afternoon,&quot; is a deconstruction of commercial culture, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as deliciously self-effacing as it is pointed and uncompromising.\n\nBut More B.S. is most compelling when it turns introspective. A story about an outlaw couple on the lam, &quot;The Ballad of Grim and Lily&quot; (written with David Baerwald and David Ricketts), is inarguably tender, as is the nostalgia-tinged regret of &quot;Sunday School and Cigarettes (Slipping Away).&quot; Even the tripped out &quot;Galaxy Song&quot; offers kind encouragement in its affirmation that we are &quot;not alone in the galaxy.&quot; And while her remake of Don HenleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; is a musical miscue, the notion of someone so young pining, &quot;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look back, Honey, never look back,&quot; is evocative and even heartbreakingÃ¢â‚¬â€suggestive of a thoughtfulness rarely associated with coffeehouse-folk-punk irony.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d1d64025f44eacfbaddae884dd220efd003f46","amp;dn":"Bree+Sharp+-+More+B.S.+%5B2002%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d1d64025f44eacfbaddae884dd220efd003f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,209,214,64,37,244,78,172,251,173,218,232,132,221,34,14,253,0,63,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
