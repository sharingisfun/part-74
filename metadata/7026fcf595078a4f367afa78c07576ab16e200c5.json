Along with his friend, Judge Paolo Borsellino, he pioneered an astonishingly complex means of tracking, trying, and punishing Mafia criminals. The nexus between the Mafia, and the country of Italy is a constant source of fascination in real life, and in fiction. And this excellent docu-drama by RAI delivers on both levels. In many ways, the drama of the series &quot;The Octopus&quot; becomes real in a tale that grows in legend year after year.Performances are uniformly good, Ennio Morricone chimes in with his usual excellent soundtrack, and the deft addition of real footage interspersed with the drama offers a different view of some rich, passionate and frightening historic events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7026fcf595078a4f367afa78c07576ab16e200c5","amp;dn":"+The+Judge+Giovanni+Falcone+%28Italy%29+2006+DVDRip+%28%2B+Eng+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7026fcf595078a4f367afa78c07576ab16e200c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,38,252,245,149,7,138,79,54,122,250,120,192,117,118,171,22,226,0,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
