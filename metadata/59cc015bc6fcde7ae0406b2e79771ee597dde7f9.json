The two albums presented here, recorded in 1959 and 1960, come from the zenith of this orchestra and present Maynard Ferguson's vision of dance music at a time in which dancing and Jazz were undergoing serious decline. By 1950, Swing music seemed a thing of the past. Modern Jazz focused on small formats or big orchestral scores which targeted concert halls as opposed to dancing establishments. Most of the dance scene had been taken over by Rock 'N' Roll and R&amp;B bands. 26 tracks. Jazz Beat.
