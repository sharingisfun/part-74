The 80's was my golden era of music. So I have scanned an old book of mine for the 80's lovers!\nIt is a graphic chronicle of the music events from mid-84 to mid-85. US and UK top 20 weekly singles and album charts are included.\nIts making was a bit resource-heavy on my hardware/software. So I had to split it in 4 parts &amp; then combine them into one PDF. But you won't see all that in the final edited book - its almost as good as a true PDF. I have OCRed it with bookmarks. You will find in it:\n\n- ACTS OF THE YEAR: PRINCE, SADE, WHAM!, U2, BILLY IDOL, MADONNA, CYNDI LAUPER, NIK KERSHAW\n- EVENTS OF THE YEAR, BAND AID\n- QUOTES OF THE YEAR,\n- TRENDS, FASHION\n- BEST AND WORST AWARDS\n- REVIEWS OF THE MAJOR ALBUMS, SINGLES, VIDEOS, BOOKS\n- REPORTS AND ANALYSES OF THE YEAR IN ROCK, REGGAE, HIP HOP, JAZZ, BLUES, SOUL, ELECTRONIC\n- BUSINESS AND THE MEDIA\n- UPDATES ON EUROPE AND AFRICA\n- EXTENSIVE REFERENCE LISTINGS\n\nTHE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND OCCASIONALLY OBJECTIONABLE ROCK RECORD AVAILABLE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f38efc643e8c3cb666193c4db07e2967335ca30e","amp;dn":"The+Rock+Yearbook+Volume+VI+%281985%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f38efc643e8c3cb666193c4db07e2967335ca30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,142,252,100,62,140,60,182,102,25,60,77,176,126,41,103,51,92,163,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
