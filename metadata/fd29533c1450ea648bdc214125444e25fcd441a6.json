Yet despite their separation by oceans or continents, their loveÃ¢â‚¬â€of course totally forbidden, and thus impossibleÃ¢â‚¬â€continues to grow, sweeping up all those around them as well as the Spanish Empire in its wake. As always, Oliveira is a master at creating a sense of period and place from the most minimal of details, a talent well on display in a story of unrequited lovers that unfolds across several decades on four continents, the loversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ separation only increasing the intensity of their feeling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd29533c1450ea648bdc214125444e25fcd441a6","amp;dn":"The+Satin+Slipper+%28Le+soulier+de+satin%29+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd29533c1450ea648bdc214125444e25fcd441a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,41,83,60,20,80,234,100,139,220,33,65,37,68,78,37,252,212,65,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
