Bottom Of The World\n\nThe voice and guitar of globetrotting Folk-Punk legends The Men They CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Hang, Phil Ã¢â‚¬ËœSwillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Odgers, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really start out here intending to make a proper solo album. However, the online success of his country covers EP, in particular KristoffersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iconic Ã¢â‚¬ËœSunday Morning Coming DownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, was received so well, he has now assembled a hand-picked gang of cohorts to record Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe Godforsaken VoyageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nThe Kristofferson song is included here too, and sits alongside lower key moments from other greats in Gene Clark (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Through The Morning, Through The NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a stunningly beautifully mournful and sparse country waltz featuring Eliza Carthy), Tom Waits and also his own TMTCH band mate Paul Simmonds, on the lamenting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dusty FieldsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“His Masters WhipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as well as featuring five Odgers originals which more than stand up here. The sound is simple, spacious and refined with a gentle folk and country feel; acoustic guitars are layered with accordions and violins, banjos, cajons and organs to compliment Odgers plaintive croon. Produced, engineered and mixed by Mike Glossop (of Waterboys/Van Morrison fame) the soul of this material is in its characters - the downtrodden, world weary and oppressed workers. The characters in these narratives have a clear affinity with the land and their environment (SimmondsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ contributions in particular). The title track is a contribution to a project set up by acclaimed Aussie Mick Thomas concerning Australian colonisation; its industrial revolution setting is a backdrop for newfangled machines stealing jobs and livelihoods, violent uprisings and penal retributions. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly a powerful opening shot. The best of OdgenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-written tunes (Ã¢â‚¬ËœNamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWrong SideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) too are sharp and melodic folk-pop tunes that are hued with just enough regret and storytelling nouse to sit comfortably along his careful selection of covers.\n\nThe album closes tenderly with a hushed, almost stately, folk waltz through Tom WaitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœBottom of the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. While WaitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ absurdist imagery is in some stark contrast to the other more earthly-bound material on offer, its as good a version of the song as anyone could muster, and a fine conclusion to a hugely enjoyable record. Not simply for the worldwide TMTCH faithful, Odgers talents as a singer/songwriter and interpreter are all shown off with grace and conviction here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb7fab931f74009668acfc0b12534790c39077e","amp;dn":"Phil+Odgers+-+The+Godforsaken+Voyage+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb7fab931f74009668acfc0b12534790c39077e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,183,250,185,49,247,64,9,102,138,207,192,177,37,52,121,12,57,7,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
