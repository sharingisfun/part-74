These are no ordinary rings. They contain valuable encrypted information that reveal the new identities of every person in the Federal Witness Protection Program. When witnesses start turning up dead, only the Angels, using their expertise as masters of disguise, espionage and martial arts can stop the perpetrator, a mysterious &quot;fallen&quot; Angel. Aided by their trusty colleague, Jimmy Bosley, the Angels' adventure begins at a remote Mongolian outpost and ends only after Dylan is forced to face a dark secret from her past--a secret that puts the lives of her two best friends in danger.\n\nAudio : English\nSub : English\nFormat : mkv\nSize : 650Mb\n1280x720 m-HD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322420f803ea5068ea2ba5b3357bf0aa7722caaa","amp;dn":"Charlies+Angels+2003+-+Full+Throttle+720p+BD+m-HD+%5B650Mb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322420f803ea5068ea2ba5b3357bf0aa7722caaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,36,32,248,3,234,80,104,234,43,165,179,53,123,240,170,119,34,202,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
