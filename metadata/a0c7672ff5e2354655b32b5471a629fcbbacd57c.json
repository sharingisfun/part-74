Triumph and Loss\n\nTravel by Sea to release third record on 10/19/10: Two States and the Blindness That Follows.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Two States and the Blindness That FollowsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ once again features the pairing of singer/songwriter Kyle Kersten and multi-instrumentalist Brian Kraft. This time around, Travel by SeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound is bolstered with the addition of long time Southern California players Dan Moore (bass), John Phinney (pedal steel, banjo), Mike Cusick (drums), and Andrew Morrison (guitar). Two years of live shows with the new members have added immeasurably to Travel by SeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic landscape, allowing the songs to grow and breathe and travel in new directions. Long time listeners will recognize the sparse and desolate themes which underlie the songs and new listeners will undoubtedly be drawn to a collaboration based record that is not afraid to rock and is clearly about the journey, not the destination. The resulting cohesiveness makes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Two States and the Blindness That FollowsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their most accomplished release yet. Available at CD and electronic retailers Tuesday October 19, 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c7672ff5e2354655b32b5471a629fcbbacd57c","amp;dn":"Travel+by+Sea+-+Two+States+and+the+Blindness+that+Follows+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c7672ff5e2354655b32b5471a629fcbbacd57c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,199,103,47,245,226,53,70,85,179,43,84,113,166,41,252,187,172,213,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
