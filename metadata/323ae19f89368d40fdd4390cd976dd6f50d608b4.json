As the fabled Blood Moon approaches, the siblings encounter a new form of evil that might hold a secret to their past.\n\nHansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters is a 2013 American-German action-horror dark fantasy film with black comedy elements, co-written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola and filmed in 3D. It is a continuation to the German folk fairy tale &quot;HÃƒÂ¤nsel and Gretel&quot;, which was recorded by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812. The film stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in the title roles of a brother-and-sister duo of professional witch hunters. Famke Janssen stars as the deadly leader of a coven of evil witches that they seek out to destroy.\n\nWirkola got the idea to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being discovered by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand to prepare for the physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.\n\nOriginally scheduled for release in March 2012, Hansel and Gretel was delayed for ten months to accommodate Renner's appearances in The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy and to give Wirkola time to shoot a post-credits scene. It premiered in North America on January 25, 2013, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D, as well in D-Box motion theaters and select international 4DX theaters, and was rated R in the United States. The film will have its home media release on June 11, including a longer, unrated version on Blu-ray Disc.\n\nHansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters was generally panned by mainstream critics, particularly for what they saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing the film as unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Russia, Brazil and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $200 million for the production cost of $50 million. Due to the commercial success of the film, which was planned as the first part of a series, its sequel is currently in development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323ae19f89368d40fdd4390cd976dd6f50d608b4","amp;dn":"Hansel+and+Gretel+Witch+Hunters%282013%29DVDRip1134","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323ae19f89368d40fdd4390cd976dd6f50d608b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,58,225,159,137,54,141,64,253,212,57,12,217,118,221,111,80,214,8,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
