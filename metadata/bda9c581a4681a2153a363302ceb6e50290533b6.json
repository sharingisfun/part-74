S. Redick's acclaimed The Red Wolf Conspiracy ended: Thasha's wedding is hours away. It is a wedding that will both fulfill the promise of a mad god's return and see her murdered. Pazel has thwarted the sorcerer who would bring back the god but both sides now face deadlock. Can Thasha be saved? Can the war between two Empires be stopped? The Ruling Sea is, once again, focused on the giant ancient ship Chathrand, but now she must brave the terrors of the uncharted seas-the massive storms and the ship-swallowing whirlpools-and explore lands forgotten by the Northern world, all the time maintaining a vicious running battle with a ship half her size but nearly her match. A masterpiece of plotting and adventure, Redick's new novel takes the listener further into the labyrinthine plots and betrayals that have underscored the trilogy from the beginning. We learn more about the Ixchel as they fight for survival against the Chathrand's rats, discover more about the true motives of conspirators, live with Thasha and Pazel as they face death and deceit, and watch as the Chathrand sails into the infamous Ruling Sea.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda9c581a4681a2153a363302ceb6e50290533b6","amp;dn":"The+Ruling+Sea+-+Robert+V.S.+Redick+-+Book+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda9c581a4681a2153a363302ceb6e50290533b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,169,197,129,164,104,26,33,83,163,99,48,44,235,110,80,41,5,51,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
