With Huygens Professional you can restore images without being a specialist on image restoration and optical theory. For instance, intelligent tools make it possible for you to obtain the instrumental Point Spread Function of your microscope from an easily recorded latex bead image. This enables you to make sure that your microscope is indeed functioning optimally and ensures optimal restoration results.\n\nFeatures:\n\nAutomatic estimation of the BackGround.\nAutomatic Bleaching Effects correction.\nAutomatic deconvolution of Time Series.\nAutomatic correction for Spherical Aberration.\nGuides you along Multi Channel deconvolution.\nSimulation of microscopic image formation.\nExperimental distillation and theoretical calculation of Point Spread Functions.\nZ-drift correction.\nHandles many ? File Formats.\nRemote displaying with X11.\nPSF measurement.\nDirect Tcl/Tk command input is possible in a versatile Tcl Shell.\n4 different deconvolution algorithms to choose from for optimal results.\nVarious Image Processing Functions available for restoration and analysis, as commands or to use interactively.\nPowerful Pro Slicer viewer enable you to inspect and compare multi-channel images in 2D, 3D and time.\nFast Mip projection or volume renderer by Simulated Fluorescence Process can be used to visualize your results.\nVolume visualization with the Sfp Renderer and the optional Surface Renderer.\nInteractive analysis tools (optional): Object Analyzer, Colocalization Analyzer.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows All\n\nHomepage: http://www.svi.nl/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Use Keygen to generate personalized serial to register application.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e63f8b95227c4a8ffbe8e37483dc7374c38387b0","amp;dn":"SVI+Huygens+Pro+v4.3.1p2+Incl+Keygen-MESMERiZE+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e63f8b95227c4a8ffbe8e37483dc7374c38387b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,63,139,149,34,124,74,143,251,232,227,116,131,220,115,116,195,131,135,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
