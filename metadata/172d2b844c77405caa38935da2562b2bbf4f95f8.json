We will focus on the evolving global capitalist economic crisis and its consequences. We will examine topics such as the social costs effects of the historic long-term US unemployment, national debt crises and Ã¢â‚¬Å“austerity programsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Greece, Ireland, Spain, and beyond changes in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chinese economy and their global effects, tax reform and the entire tax issue in the US today, continuing crisis in the US housing and credit markets the economics of immigration. Actual economic developments will shape the agenda for each monthly Tuesday meeting. Rick Wolff, with occasional guests, will present an economic update and an analysis of some particular economic topics and then open the floor to questions, comments and a general discussion of where the US and world economies are going and the political implications. We aim to develop participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ understanding of and ability to explain to others the key economic developments of our time. Richard D.
