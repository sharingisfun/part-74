This book explodes some of the common myths, looks at what the numbers really mean, and addresses nine topics, such as why women in most parts of the world have fewer children, what will happen to our societies as we all live longer, and how having babies relates to climate change.\nVanessa Baird is co-editor at New Internationalist magazine. Her previous books include The No-Nonsense Guide to Sexual Diversity and, as compiler and editor, Eye to Eye Women.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ecb81e2e1e5cdd5dd17bd9bb693071733aa69e","amp;dn":"The+No-Nonsense+Guide+to+World+Population","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ecb81e2e1e5cdd5dd17bd9bb693071733aa69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,236,184,30,46,30,92,221,93,209,123,217,187,105,48,113,115,58,166,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
