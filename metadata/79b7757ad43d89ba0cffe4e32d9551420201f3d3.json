He is one of the most prolific character actors in film history, having completed over 170 movies since 1967. He has twice won the CÃƒÂ©sar Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in Green Card. After he garnered huge critical acclaim for the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac, which landed him a nomination for an Academy Award, Depardieu acted in many big budget Hollywood movies. He is a Chevalier of the LÃƒÂ©gion d'honneur, Chevalier of the Ordre national du MÃƒÂ©rite. He was granted Russian citizenship on 3 January 2013 by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nGÃƒÂ©rard Depardieu was born in ChÃƒÂ¢teauroux, Indre, France. He is one of five children of Anne Jeanne JosÃƒÂ¨phe &quot;la Liette&quot; (nÃƒÂ©e Marillier) and RenÃƒÂ© Maxime Lionel &quot;le DÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©&quot; Depardieu, a metal worker and volunteer fireman. Depardieu spent more time on the street than in the classroom and left school at 15.\n\nAt the age of 16, Depardieu left ChÃƒÂ¢teauroux for Paris. There, he began acting in the new comedy theatre CafÃƒÂ© de la Gare, along with Patrick Dewaere, Romain Bouteille, Sotha, Coluche, and Miou-Miou. \n\nHis breakout film role came in 1974 playing Jean-Claude in Bertrand Blier's comedy Going Places. He studied dancing under Jean-Laurent Cochet, and went on to become one of France's most renowned actors. In 1986, his international fame grew as a result of his performance as a doomed, hunchbacked farmer in the film Jean de Florette. Five years later he won a CÃƒÂ©sar for his starring role in Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nGerard crossed over into the American film market by co-starring in the 1990 film Green Card. He has since had other roles in five English-language films, My Father the Hero, The Man in the Iron Mask, 102 Dalmatians, Last Holiday, and Life of Pi.\nMore recently, he has played ObÃƒÂ©lix in the four live-action AstÃƒÂ©rix movies in which he is said to have discovered MÃƒÂ©lanie Laurent when she was 14.\n\nList Of Films In Part One.
