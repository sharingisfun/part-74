Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) es el pilar de su comunidad... hasta que se entera que su ex-amante (Anjelica Huston) planea sacar a la luz sus iregularidades financieras y extramaritales.. Mientras Cliff sse decide entre la integridad o venderse y Judah se debate entre los consejos de su rabino (Sam Waterson) y de su malicioso hermano (Jerry Orbach), cada uno deberÃƒÂ¡ examinar su propia moral y tomar una decisiÃƒÂ³n irrevocable que cambiarÃƒÂ¡ sus vidas para siempre\n\n\nWoody AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crimes and MisdemeanorsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ intertwines two stories. The first involves Judah, a wealthy ophthalmologist and family man, who has had a several-year affair with Dolores. Dolores threatens to go public regarding the affair and JudahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shady financial dealings unless Judah leaves his wife. Judah calls on his mobster brother to kill Dolores, which he does. The second storyline involves Cliff, a nerdy and unsuccessful documentary filmmaker, who is in an unhappy marriage. While working on a documentary about a TV personality named Lester, Cliff falls in love with Halley, a network producer. Halley rebuffs Cliff because he is married. When Cliff finally gets divorced, Halley has become engaged to Lester. Throughout both storylines discussions arise about GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in establishing ethical values, and whether the world would be valueless if God didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist. Judah and Cliff meet up at the end of the film, and Judah presents an anonymous version of the murder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as though it might be a plot for a movie. It becomes clear that Judah got away with the murder, and suffered no long-term guilt. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including best screenplay and best director.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d303a11d9a813b5259cde23e80d5a9c050a64649","amp;dn":"Crimenes+Y+Pecados+%28Crimes+and+Misdemeanors%29+DVD+NTSC+Esng+Esp-L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d303a11d9a813b5259cde23e80d5a9c050a64649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,3,161,29,154,129,59,82,89,205,226,62,128,213,169,192,80,166,70,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
