Columbia chose, instead, to license its 1940s Herman masters to Mosaic. With its customary thoroughness, Mosaic goes well beyond The Thundering Herds. To give you an idea of what Mosaic means by complete, the seven-CD set includes nine previously unissued takes by the Woodchoppers, the incomparable nine-piece group within the First Herd. &quot;Steps,&quot; &quot;Igor,&quot; &quot;Fan It,&quot; &quot;Lost Weekend,&quot; &quot;Pam,&quot; &quot;I Surrender Dear&quot; and &quot;Someday Sweetheart&quot; each appear in at least one newly discovered take in addition to the original issues, along with the originals of &quot;Four Men on a Horse&quot; and &quot;Nero's Conception.&quot; (JazzTimes)\n\nEnjoy and share!
