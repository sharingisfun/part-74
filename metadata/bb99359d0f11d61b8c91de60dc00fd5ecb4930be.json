In many cases, the missions are more open ended. While the original game contained several missions that required you not to be detected or to avoid setting off alarms, the sequel contained only a few objectives that required complete stealth (i.e. do not set off any alarms while in the proximity of a certain objective.) However, to counter this, NOLF2 utilizes re-spawning enemies more often than the original to encourage the player to complete the missions in a surreptitious manner.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n-The ISO files Are Password Protected\n-The passwords are the same as the file name(s), excluding the .iso extension\n-Copy and paste the name of the game(s) in the little dialog box\n-Either mount using an image processor program onto a virtual drive or extract to    any desired location that you prefer.\n-Open the game folder(s) and search for the executive button to play instantly!!!!\n-Injoy quality rips only from [The-B1ight3r]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb99359d0f11d61b8c91de60dc00fd5ecb4930be","amp;dn":"%5BNo+One+Lives+Forever+Pack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb99359d0f11d61b8c91de60dc00fd5ecb4930be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,153,53,157,15,17,214,27,140,145,222,96,220,0,253,94,203,73,48,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
