Since losing a fortune in the 1987 stock market crash, which also cost him his marriage, David has led a Robinson Crusoe-like existence. Ben learns how to pick oysters, brew beer, trade fish and dance with the locals, finding out how it feels to truly live alone.\n\n2)  Alaska \nBen travels north to Alaska to live with Bretwood Higman, Erin McCittrick and their two children. Bretwood and Erin hiked 4,000 miles to get here, and the family now lives for half the year in a Mongolian-style yurt on the mountainside, with the other half spent hiking in the wilderness. While staying with them, Ben learns how to chop trees and protect himself from grizzly bears.\n\n3)  New Zealand \nBen travels to New Zealand, where he meets the Long family, who live as hunter-gatherers in the Gorge River area of National Park. He helps dad Robert to hunt for rock lobsters and catch eels, while mum Catherine must climb a sheer waterfall to check for storm damage to the family's gravity-fed water pipe.\n\n4)  Texas \nTerlingua, a crumbling ghost town a couple of miles from the Mexican border in Texas, is the last staging post for Ben on his way to meet John Wells, an ex-fashion photographer from New York who has turned his back on the bright lights of the big city to experience a desolate desert dream.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3470/newlivesinthewildscreenl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3470/newlivesinthewildscreenl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1897 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832 x 464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (~16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: average 650 MB\nEncoded by Harry65\nSource: PDTV \n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b6945224ad5bbb3414b0c154570fe7481c66b6","amp;dn":"Ch5+New+Lives+in+the+Wild+1of4+Australia+PDTV+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b6945224ad5bbb3414b0c154570fe7481c66b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,182,148,82,36,173,91,187,52,20,176,193,84,87,15,231,72,28,102,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
