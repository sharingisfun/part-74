I wrote a program to get all the comic and silies but it was done in a rash. The tests I did worked fine so... here's wishing...\n\nOne of the best webcomics out there in my opinion.\n\nFor those just looking for something to read and don't actually know what this is about...\n\nFrom wiki because really have no clue how to describe it:\n\nThe plot of Ctrl+Alt+Del revolves around Ethan, the protagonist and an over-the-top video game fanatic, and his sarcastic roommate Lucas, who provides an unheeded voice of reason to Ethan's flamboyant actions. Together with Ethan's girlfriend the three engage in turmoil which the comic storyline conveys through independent gaming-related puns by utilizing well-known game titles, consoles and pop culture references. A psychotic Chef Brian, ninjas, and mysterious out-of-the-blue arrows occasionally appear in the series, adding a note of randomness to the comic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0310943fb9d39dafc2a6e9ec5ee77f800727fe3","amp;dn":"Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel+%26amp%3B+Sillies+%2814-04-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0310943fb9d39dafc2a6e9ec5ee77f800727fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,49,9,67,251,157,57,218,252,42,110,158,197,238,119,248,0,114,127,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
