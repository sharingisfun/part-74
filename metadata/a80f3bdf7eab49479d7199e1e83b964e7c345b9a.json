You'll hear about communities printing their own money, growing food, localising their economies and setting up community power stations. It's an idea that has gone viral, a social experiment that is about responding to uncertain times with solutions and optimism. In a world of increasing uncertainty, here is a story of hope, ingenuity and the power of growing vegetables in unexpected places&quot;.\n\nIt has been produced by Emma Goude, with animation by Emilio Mula, photography by Beccy Strong and with stunning original music by Rebecca Mayes. They have drawn together stories from around the world showing Transition initiatives at the various stages of transitioning their communities. In order to be able to feature some of the stories from overseas, they ran a crowd-funding process which raised the money required. An international team of volunteers have translated the film in 18 languages. Also, in spite of telling stories from around the world, no-one set foot on an aeroplane in order to make this film, local camera-people being enlisted to film each sequence, making this one of the lowest-carbon international films ever produced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a80f3bdf7eab49479d7199e1e83b964e7c345b9a","amp;dn":"In+Transition+2.0+DVDRip+Xvid+BY-RSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a80f3bdf7eab49479d7199e1e83b964e7c345b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,15,59,223,126,171,73,71,157,113,153,225,232,59,150,78,124,52,91,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
