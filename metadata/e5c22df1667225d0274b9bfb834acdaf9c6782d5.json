Stuckey was 19 years old and serving 60 years in prison for murder. Four years later he was freed on appeal and set out to build his dream, Motor City Records. Stuckey's record label was poised on the brink of success with artists like Eminem's best friend &quot;&quot;Proof&quot;&quot; and the cream of the Detroit hip hop underground under his umbrella. Then the feds stepped in. After he beat yet another murder case, the federal government used informants to finally convict him of killing a former Detroit police officer and running a cocaine empire, charges which he continues to fight. This documentary features an original score by Tone &quot;&quot;A.K.&quot;&quot; Scott and Square Biz.\n\n\nPlease Seed &amp; Enjoy\n-2013-Mastamind\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c22df1667225d0274b9bfb834acdaf9c6782d5","amp;dn":"T-Stuckey+The+Documentary+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c22df1667225d0274b9bfb834acdaf9c6782d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,194,45,241,102,114,37,208,39,75,155,251,131,74,205,175,156,103,130,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
