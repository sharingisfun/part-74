Though the stylistic collisions in her singing sometimes result in confused mannerism, Snow is a true original. Unfortunately, since the debut LP, the confusions have dominated.&quot; ***\n- Stephen Holden, Rolling Stone\n\n&quot;Although the rumors of a major new artist that began after the success of &quot;Poetry Man&quot;--still her sappiest song, although the lyrics here aren't what they call creative writing--originated with fuzzy-minded mongers, I'm pleased to report that her trademark melismatic quaver hasn't degenerated into a gimmick, and I acknowledge that this is a good record of its type. I just have my doubts about how good a jazz-folk mood-music record can be. Money isn't all that's &quot;worthless/When your music's mirthless&quot;--sometimes the music is as well.&quot; B\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee6f595868a1c2dcc9fdb468b71901c5fdd1935","amp;dn":"Phoebe+Snow+-+Second+Childhood+%281976+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee6f595868a1c2dcc9fdb468b71901c5fdd1935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,230,245,149,134,138,28,45,204,159,219,70,139,113,144,28,95,221,25,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
