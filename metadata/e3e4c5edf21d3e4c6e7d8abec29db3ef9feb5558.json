The End Times are here, get yourself ready. This no more time to get your congregation ready.\n\nDescription\n\nDescription\n\nRedesigning the Church for the Age to Come is a charge to believing Christians to reignite their passion for serving Jesus.\n\nMany know the truth of the Scriptures but the power of God resides in the application of these truths.\n\nLiving in an age where it is growing more and more dark, we, as Believers, must trim our wicks and brighten our intensity in order to illuminate the world by letting our lights so shine! I believe there will be one last great revival and it will be led by everyday Believers who are following as close to Jesus as they possible can! Join with those who once again want the Church to have the reputation as &quot;those who are turning the world upside down!&quot;\n\nThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teaching\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, to Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e4c5edf21d3e4c6e7d8abec29db3ef9feb5558","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+The+Word+-+017+-+Redesigning+the+Church+for+the+Age+to+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e4c5edf21d3e4c6e7d8abec29db3ef9feb5558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,228,197,237,242,29,62,76,110,125,138,190,194,157,179,239,159,235,85,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
