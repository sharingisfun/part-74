Underneath her gentle finger-picked guitar and girlish but graceful voice, does this L.A.-based singer-songwriter, originally from Chicago, provide the song structure to support all this loveliness?\n\nShe does Ã¢â‚¬â€ and each listen to her 11 songs (and one Mason Jennings cover) reveals a new melodic turn that the ear didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pick up on before. Recruiting a stable of musicians, including Drive-By TruckersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ John Neff on pedal steel, Orenda Fink from Azure Ray on vocals and producer Andy LeMaster (Bright Eyes, R.E.M.) on slide guitar and a slew of other instruments, Rose picked the right company to realize this highly textured collection that explores a few different moods, though always at a tender remove.\n\nOn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Simple Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its peals of mandolin and plinking toy piano, Rose wishes to go back to a time thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still ripe with hope. Over the playfully cantering rhythms of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Another Breakup Ballad,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she kicks a dodgy lover to the curb. But the fragmentary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lavender MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the standout, a spooked love song kissed with atmospherics that would give Tom Waits the shivers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd4f969c90180bef3c75009446c2268c23694fb","amp;dn":"Haroula+Rose+-+These+Open+Roads+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd4f969c90180bef3c75009446c2268c23694fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,212,249,105,201,1,128,190,243,199,80,9,68,108,34,104,194,54,148,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
