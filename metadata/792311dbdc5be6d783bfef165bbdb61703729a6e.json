Renowned Swedish photographer Lennart Nilsson presents the incredible voyage of a new life with his stunning look at the microscopic world of the human body. Magnification of up to half a million times actual size shows just what happens at the moment of conception, and how a single new cell forms first an embryo, then a fetus.&quot;\n\nContent Advisory: Shows a human birth in graphic detail.\n\nNote: Wikipedia calls this episode S25E04 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\nThis episode doesn't seem to have been posted yet, so I'm happy to give back for the almost two hundred episodes of this amazing show that I've found here.\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others! My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.\nIf everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792311dbdc5be6d783bfef165bbdb61703729a6e","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+S10E12+-+The+Miracle+of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792311dbdc5be6d783bfef165bbdb61703729a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,35,17,219,220,91,230,215,131,191,239,22,91,189,182,23,3,114,154,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
