Based in Portland, OR, they have ties to a number of other Northwest acts like Hutch &amp; Kathy (the latter drums for the AGSFB) and the Softies (AGSFB guitarist Jen Sbragia and Tiger Trap's Rose Melberg), among others. But the AGSFB are more than just a side project; they aren't really even a &quot;project&quot; at all -- more like a state of mind. Just as the Beach Boys once famously titled an album Endless Summer, that's the state of mind the AGSFB evoke on their Calvin Johnson-produced debut. Not that everything is sunshine and roses; summers aren't always happy, after all. Sometimes relationships don't work out (&quot;Cut Your Hair&quot; -- not the Pavement song), sometimes your wheels break down (&quot;Car Trouble&quot;), etc. The weather may be nicer than usual, but life goes on, and bad things happen. But solidarity is a defense against disappointment, as in &quot;Theme Song,&quot; in which the gals proclaim with pride, &quot;We're the all girl summer fun band.&quot; And that they are. A lot more real than Josie &amp; the Pussycats or The Powerpuff Girls -- but just as much fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e9f23ee3c5324c02ed5fe8b32c00453d286f76","amp;dn":"All+Girl+Summer+Fun+Band+-+All+Girl+Summer+Fun+Band+%5B2002%5D+%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e9f23ee3c5324c02ed5fe8b32c00453d286f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,233,242,62,227,197,50,76,2,237,95,232,179,44,0,69,61,40,111,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
