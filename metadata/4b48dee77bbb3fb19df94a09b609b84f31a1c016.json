By the spring of 1943, the 3000 members of the Einsatzgruppen, led by highly-educated officers and aided by local collaborators in each country, had systematically murdered over a million Jews and tens of thousands Roma, handicapped, partisans, Communists and Soviets. Who were these men who organized and carried out mass murder at close range?\n\nPrazanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitive masterwork is one of the essential films documenting the Holocaust and features a powerful array of astounding, never-seen-before film and photographs (some in color) discovered by the filmmakers in Eastern European archives. Prazan interviews a slate of internationally renowned historians, including Christopher Browning, Christian Ingrao, Martin Dean and Ralf Ogorreck, along with Holocaust survivors, witnesses and perpetrators (several filmed using hidden cameras).\n\nThe filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scope is broad, treating the EinsatzgruppenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership, rank-and-file and collaborators, the machinations of their operations and the attempts soon after to dig up and destroy the evidence. The later part of the film explores efforts to bring members of the Einsatzgruppen to justice. Benjamin Ferencz, prosecutor of the Einsatzgruppen trial, is interviewed at length.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b48dee77bbb3fb19df94a09b609b84f31a1c016","amp;dn":"Einsatzgruppen%3A+The+Death+Brigades+%28Les+Commandos+de+la+Mort%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b48dee77bbb3fb19df94a09b609b84f31a1c016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,72,222,231,123,187,63,177,157,249,74,9,182,9,184,79,49,161,192,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
