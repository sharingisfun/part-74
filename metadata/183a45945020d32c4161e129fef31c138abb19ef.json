The toys, led by Huggy Bear, Andy's childhood teddy bear, rebel and try to destroy the new toys.\nEach boss in the game has taken over a specific area of the house, serving as one of Huggy Bear's Generals.\n\nBasically, you control different toys at different points in the game, you even get to control a jet pack wielding Santa Clause. The wiki on this game claims there were issues with tricky controls, but I played this using Xpadder &amp; Xbox360 gamepad, &amp; it was very easy as far as control go. This is a Dreamcast only game, but it emulates very well.\n\n1) Install.\n2) Use the shortcut to launch.\n3) Go to &quot;System&quot;, then press &quot;Start&quot;.\n\nThe emulator is already pre-configured for this game, if you want to adjust the reolution, just go into the NullDC settings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kamLFaaEl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kamLFaaEl&lt;/a&gt;\n\nXpadder with Profiles for Xbox360 &amp; PS3 are included.\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaMlGAAeL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaMlGAAeL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:183a45945020d32c4161e129fef31c138abb19ef","amp;dn":"Toy+Commander+%28Dreamcast+Emulation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"183a45945020d32c4161e129fef31c138abb19ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,58,69,148,80,32,211,44,65,97,225,41,254,243,28,19,138,187,25,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
