While walking down the sidewalk, he is suddenly hit by a car (crushed by construction beams in the anime). On the verge of death, he is seen by a young woman clad in gothic clothes. She then resurrects him, leaving him alive in the hospital morgue. He wakes up confused over what happened, only to encounter the woman again as she eliminates some wolf creatures. She addresses Hiro as &quot;her servant&quot; and introduces herself as &quot;Hime&quot; (Japanese for Princess) and explains that she is a member of the royal family of the Monster Realm.\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nAubs: Eng\nEps: 25\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\nFormat: .mkv\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b89149dda3f9068025465b833933f9c23e5838","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DPrincess+Resurrection+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b89149dda3f9068025465b833933f9c23e5838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,184,145,73,221,163,249,6,128,37,70,91,131,57,51,249,194,62,88,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
