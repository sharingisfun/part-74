Although the word &quot;again&quot; is added to McLean's two originals, the barnburner &quot;Appointment in Ghana&quot; and &quot;Little Melonae,&quot; they aren't very different from earlier recordings in concept. McLean also shines in ballad settings of &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot; and &quot;'Round Midnight.&quot; Jones' advanced playing may be a eye-opener for some fans who do not realize how advanced and wide ranging a pianist he is. Like many fine recordings made for the Japanese label East Wind, these 1978 sessions pairing Jackie McLean with the Great Jazz Trio have long been out of print and fetched high prices from collectors.
