While the Watergate hearings blast from the TV, the wayward Hood and Carver families try to navigate a Thanksgiving break simmering with unspoken resentments, sexual experimentation, and cultural confusion. With crystalline clarity, characteristic subtlety, and even a dose of wicked humor, Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee adapts Rick Moody's acclaimed novel of American malaise into a trenchant, tragic portrait of lost souls. Featuring a cast of tremendously talented adults (Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver) and kids (up-and-coming stars Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood), The Ice Storm is one of the finest films of the nineties.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nNew, restored high-definition digital transfer, supervised and approved by director Ang Lee and director of photography Frederick Elmes\nAudio commentary featuring Ang Lee and producer-screenwriter James Schamus\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
