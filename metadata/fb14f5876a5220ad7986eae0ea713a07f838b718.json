TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still without McVie on their new four-song EP, but they fixed Ã¢â‚¬ËœSay You WillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest problem by keeping Ã¢â‚¬ËœExtended PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at an economical 17 minutes. And if it sounds more like a Lindsey Buckingham record than an actual band one at times, at least Ã¢â‚¬ËœExtended PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the best thing released under the Fleetwood Mac moniker since 1987Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœTango in the Night.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nIn fact, Ã¢â‚¬ËœExtended Play,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which is available exclusively on iTunes, sounds a lot like BuckinghamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent solo albums, but with a punchier rhythm section and Stevie NicksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ backing vocals. All of which give the music way more life than if Buckingham Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose insular approach to his solo records often make them sound thin and narrow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would have recorded them himself.\n\nThe opening Ã¢â‚¬ËœSad Angel,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ propelled by acoustic guitar and a killer hook, crackles with more energy than anything the band or Buckingham, who wrote and sings lead on all but one of the EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four tracks, has done in years. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt that Nicks and Buckingham still make a great singing team, chiming in on the choruses like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1977 again. The song is the highlight of Ã¢â‚¬ËœExtended PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and its only real uptempo track.\n\nBut the remaining three songs are almost as good, especially the closing Ã¢â‚¬ËœMiss Fantasy,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a shuffling pop number featuring a whispered vocal by Buckingham, with Nicks pushing along the choruses. The hushed piano ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœIt Takes TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is mostly Buckingham until the final minute, when strings swell around the spare melody. And Nicks and Buckingham share lead vocals on Ã¢â‚¬ËœWithout You,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a leftover cut from the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-Fleetwood Mac duo days written by Nicks.\n\nFleetwood Mac have been performing a couple of the songs on their current tour, so in a way, Ã¢â‚¬ËœExtended PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ doubles as a show souvenir for fans wanting new material from the band. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not essential Mac by any means, but after all these years, and all these years apart, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to know that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still capable of making some sweet music together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb14f5876a5220ad7986eae0ea713a07f838b718","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Extended+Play+-+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb14f5876a5220ad7986eae0ea713a07f838b718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,20,245,135,106,82,32,173,121,134,234,224,234,113,58,7,248,56,183,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
