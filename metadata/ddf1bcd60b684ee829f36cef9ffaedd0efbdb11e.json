Released June 3rd on Cooking Vinyl, the set features further excursions from last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sessions at the Starhouse studio in Berlin, plus new instrumental versions.\n\n  Ball Of Fire Comes complete with a killer selection of dubwise remixes from like-minded low-end explorers Dabrye, Deadbeat and Mad Prosessor, with the latter two delivering both vocal and dub versions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf1bcd60b684ee829f36cef9ffaedd0efbdb11e","amp;dn":"The+Orb+-+Ball+of+Fire+%28EP%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf1bcd60b684ee829f36cef9ffaedd0efbdb11e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,241,188,214,11,104,78,232,41,243,108,239,159,250,237,208,239,189,177,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
