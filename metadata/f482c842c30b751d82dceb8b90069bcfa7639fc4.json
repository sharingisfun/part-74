Then a new couple moves in down the street, and Andrew finds himself falling for Nathan in a big way. Nathan is straight, married, and just about to be a father, but after one fateful night out together at a club, Nathan has to face the fact that his feelings for Andrew go way beyond that of a friend and neighbor.\n\nWhen AndrewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife asks for a divorce, both menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives are thrown into disarray. Arguments about their responsibilities to their wives and children, doubting themselves and each other, and some harrowing lies pull them apartÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but they never leave each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f482c842c30b751d82dceb8b90069bcfa7639fc4","amp;dn":"Nothing+Ever+Happens+by+Sue+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f482c842c30b751d82dceb8b90069bcfa7639fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,130,200,66,195,11,117,29,130,220,235,139,144,6,155,207,167,99,159,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
