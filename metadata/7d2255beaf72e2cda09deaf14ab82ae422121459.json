Another plugin by popular demand.\n* Effector - 12 performance oriented effects: Distortion, Lo-Fi bit reduction, Flanging, Phasing, Filter (low/high pass), Delay, Reverb, Stereo panning &amp; binaural effect, Gating, Granulizer, Vocal formant and Ring modulation effects.

Shortcuts &amp; mouse actions now harmonize with FL StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Piano roll and Playlist, where possible. Most exciting are the new Vibrato and Warp editors. The Vibrato editor allows users to create vibrato effects from scratch with controls including start/end amount and frequency. The editor even detects existing vibrato and displays this value so users can match the singers natural tendency, if desired. The Warp editor is designed to work with mono or polyphonic material and is perfect for slicing and re-timing/quantizing drum-loops, vocal performances and is great for sounddesign experimentation. Importantly, Newtone 2 is a free update for existing customers.\n\n* Harmor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rising star of the Electro and Dubstep scene, voted in the top 10 plugins of 2013 by MusicRadar readers, now supports Komplexer WT wavetables &amp; 'Map audio regions to keys' for sampler like functionality and auto-dump to score for Slicex like drum handling.
