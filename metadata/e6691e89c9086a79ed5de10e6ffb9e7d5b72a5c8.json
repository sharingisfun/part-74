The album was certified gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1995.\nThe concept, as envisioned by Waters in 1977, rotated around a man's scattered thoughts during a road trip through somewhere in Central Europe, focusing on his midlife crisis, and how he dreams of committing adultery with a hitchhiker he picks up along the way. Along the way he also faces other fears and paranoia, with all of these things taking place in real time in the early morning hours of 04:30:18 AM to 05:12 AM on an unspecified day.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. 4:30 am (Apparently They Were Travelling Abroad)\n2. 4:33 am (Running Shoes)\n3. 4:37 am (Arabs With Knives And West German Skies)\n4. 4:39 am (For The First Time Today - Part 2)\n5. 4:41 am (Sexual Revolution)\n6. 4:47 am (The Remains Of Our Love)\n7. 4:50 am (Go Fishing)\n8. 4:56 am (For The First Time Today - Part 1)\n9. 4:58 am (Dunro amin, Duncarin, Dunlivin)\n10. 5:01 am (The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking)\n11. 5:06 am (Every Strangers Eyes)\n12. 5:11 am (The Moment Of Clarity)\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Progressive rock, blues rock\nSource: Vinyl\n\n\nMediaInspector Report:\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 42mn 8s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 5 220 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nStream size : 1.54 GiB (100%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6691e89c9086a79ed5de10e6ffb9e7d5b72a5c8","amp;dn":"The+Pros+And+Cons+Of+Hitch+Hiking+%5BVinylRip+24+bits+FLAC%5D+%7B100.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6691e89c9086a79ed5de10e6ffb9e7d5b72a5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,105,30,137,201,8,106,121,237,93,225,14,111,251,158,125,91,114,165,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
