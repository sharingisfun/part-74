The game is the fucking best fps ever - cs 1.6. \nFollowing fragmovie video is legendary. You cannot find any other of this kind. I saw a lot of fragmovies of past decade (about Spawn, Fnatic and SK team members, Arbalet cups, Na'Vi's winout, Asus cups, etc) and I'm confident enough to state this. \n\nFukken enjoy it and don't forget to seed. I had hard times to acquire this shit through internets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd0b67318a62725d9a9fa250a908795e7611744","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike+Underground+%28legendary+cs+1.6+fragmovie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd0b67318a62725d9a9fa250a908795e7611744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,208,182,115,24,166,39,37,217,169,250,37,10,144,135,149,231,97,23,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
