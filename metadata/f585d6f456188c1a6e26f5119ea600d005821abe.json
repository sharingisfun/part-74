Welcome to the mind-bending new comic book series about a TV show where super-powered teens and 20-somethings are competing for the ultimate dream-prize: a guaranteed spot in that world's top super-group, The Powered Protectors. The chance of winning offers fame, fortune, massive endorsement deals and, of course, a chance to actually save the world. Kids who dream of being worshipped as the next great, iconic hero would be falling all over themselves to get on -- and hopefully even win -- the show. Against this backdrop, IDOLIZED is the story of a girl with fledgling superpowers and a dark past, who seeks revenge, and ultimately finds redemption, over the course of competing in this televised superhero competition show. It's True Grit meets American Idol...with capes!\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f585d6f456188c1a6e26f5119ea600d005821abe","amp;dn":"Idolized+0-5+%28Complete%29+%281440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28Tarutaru-Novus%29%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f585d6f456188c1a6e26f5119ea600d005821abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,214,244,86,24,140,26,110,38,245,17,158,166,0,208,5,130,26,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
