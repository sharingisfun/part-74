The film portrays four girls Ã¢â‚¬â€ three of whom are named Heather Ã¢â‚¬â€ in a clique at a fictional Ohio high school.[1]\n\nThe film brought director Michael Lehmann and producer Denise Di Novi the 1990 Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Daniel Waters also gained recognition for his screenplay, which won a 1990 Edgar Award.[2] The film was a U.S. box office failure,[3] but went on to become a cult classic, with high rentals and sales business. In 2006, it was ranked #5 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;[4] and in 2008, it was ranked #412 on Empire's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.[5]\n\nCast\n\nWinona Ryder as Veronica Sawyer\nChristian Slater as Jason &quot;J.D.&quot; Dean\nShannen Doherty as Heather Duke\nLisanne Falk as Heather McNamara\nKim Walker as Heather Chandler\nPenelope Milford as Pauline Fleming\nGlenn Shadix as Father Ripper\nLance Fenton as Kurt Kelly\nPatrick Labyorteaux as Ram Sweeney\nJeremy Applegate as Peter Dawson\nJon Matthews as Rodney\nCarrie Lynn as Martha &quot;Dumptruck&quot; Dunnstock\nPhill Lewis as Dennis\nRenÃƒÂ©e Estevez as Betty Finn\nJennifer Rhodes as Mrs. Sawyer\nBill Cort as Mr. Sawyer\nKirk Scott as Big Bud Dean\nMark Carlton as Mr. Kelly\nJohn Ingle as Principal Gowan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c5af7ffb0ac81bac7f2affef0003c022d2ce4a","amp;dn":"Heathers+%5B20th+Anniv.+Edition%5D+Commentary%2C+Subs%2C+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c5af7ffb0ac81bac7f2affef0003c022d2ce4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,197,175,127,251,10,200,27,172,127,42,255,239,0,3,192,34,210,206,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
