It is the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, as the first of a three-part prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the first film in the saga in terms of story chronology. The film was also Lucas' first production as a film director after a 22-year hiatus following the original Star Wars film, and only his fourth overall. It was produced by Rick McCallum and Lucasfilm Ltd.\n \nThe film follows the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, who escort and protect Queen Amidala in traveling from the planet Naboo to the planet Coruscant in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a large-scale interplanetary trade dispute. It also features a young Anakin Skywalker before he became a Jedi, introduced as a young slave boy who seems to be unusually strong with nascent powers of The Force, and must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\n\nFor the first film released, see Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b1ea4e39a95f6f5ab96e5bf6bb2f82640df57fb","amp;dn":"star+wars+1+-+phantom+menace+-+clean+jarjar+cuts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b1ea4e39a95f6f5ab96e5bf6bb2f82640df57fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,30,164,227,154,149,246,245,171,150,229,191,107,178,248,38,64,223,87,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
