Edison released their album Ã¢â‚¬Å“to reduce the choir to one soloistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1996, but the recordings date back to 1993/1994, these nine tracks comprise the entirety of AcmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recorded career (one 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, three compilation tracks, one demo).\n\nPresumably the band take their musical cues from early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Hardcore bands such as Born Against and Ã¢â‚¬ËœProtestantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-era Rorschach, but this is occluded so thoroughly by a dense (funeral) fog of extreme metal, sludge and grind that their original Hardcore influences are difficult to pinpoint.
