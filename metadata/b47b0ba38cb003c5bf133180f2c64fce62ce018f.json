It was released on June 1, 2011. The single was written and composed by YUI. She said that she attempted to make the song sound pop-like, while trying to add a slight pizzicato which she picked up from the atmosphere of Paradise Kiss.[1] She also said the song was one of deciding to prepare oneself, while finding answers as you mature. The music video depicts Yui in a variety of clothes while using a variety of all her guitars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47b0ba38cb003c5bf133180f2c64fce62ce018f","amp;dn":"YUI+-+HELLO+%7EParadise+Kiss%7E+%5B1440x1080+SSTV+HD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47b0ba38cb003c5bf133180f2c64fce62ce018f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,123,11,163,140,176,3,197,191,19,49,128,242,198,79,206,98,206,1,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
