He then fills it in with a tint of etymology and a smattering of quotes that show how the word is used, ending with a list of companion words. The words themselves range from commonplace Ã¢â‚¬â€ like biscuit, a twice-baked cake for Roman soldiers Ã¢â‚¬â€ to loanwords including chaparral, from the Basque shepherds who came to the American West; words from myths, such as hector; metamorphosis words, like silly, which evolved holy to goofy in a mere thousand years; and words well worthy of revival, such as carrytale, a wandering storyteller. Whether old-fangled or brand new, all the words included in The Painted Word possess an ineffable quality that makes them luminous.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53170bb274be63d63d9574367645604d994125b","amp;dn":"The+Painted+Word%3A++Remarkable+Words+and+Their+Origins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53170bb274be63d63d9574367645604d994125b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,49,112,187,39,75,230,61,99,217,87,67,103,100,86,4,217,148,18,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
