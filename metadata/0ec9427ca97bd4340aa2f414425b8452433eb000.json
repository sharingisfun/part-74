Take the greatest elements of MasterChef Australia you know and love, add an international host, a cravat or two, a brand new, state-of-the-art commercial kitchen, a 120-seat restaurant, and lay it all out on the table for 18 chefs at the top of their game from all over the country.\n\nMasterChef: The Professionals will see these qualified chefs competing in the toughest cooking environment in Australia.\n\nThe contestants will be guided by acclaimed chef Marco Pierre White. Having had some of the world's most successful chefs in his kitchens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Gordon Ramsay and Australia's own Shannon Bennett and Curtis Stone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ White will challenge, inspire and mentor the 18 professionals. By his side, ensuring that no element of the dish goes unnoticed, will be MasterChef AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perennial favourite, esteemed food critic Matt Preston.\n\nBe prepared to meet some of the country's most innovative and exciting chefs, competing to win a career-defining, money-can't buy experience.\n\nFor these qualified chefs, food is their world, their passion, their love. From all walks of life, each chef has their own unique food story and culinary background to bring to the table.\n\nFilmed in Melbourne and produced by Shine Australia, MasterChef: The Professionals will bring some fresh elements to the MasterChef Australia format.\n\nIt will build on the foundations of MasterChef Australia, then turn it on its head. While viewers will still see some of their favourite challenges and guest chefs, the experience and competition will be intensified. These are professional chefs and the challenges they will face reflect their experience. For viewers, that leaves only one thing to do: prepare to be taken to a whole new level.\n\nIt's the last challenge of finals week as the top four contestants split into two teams to create their own pop up restaurants, with a place in the finale at stake.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec9427ca97bd4340aa2f414425b8452433eb000","amp;dn":"Masterchef.The.Professionals.AU.s01e24.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec9427ca97bd4340aa2f414425b8452433eb000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,201,66,124,169,123,212,52,10,162,244,20,66,91,132,82,67,62,176,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
