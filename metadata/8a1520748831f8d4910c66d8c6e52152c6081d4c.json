Cast apart because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poor and his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drunk, Farouk is not happy in his village. When his father dies, he decides to go in the mountains with his best friends.\n\nLooking for nature at its purest, the two teenage boys have to deal with the cruelty of violent barbarians. Their trip will also make them meet a lost orphan girl and a wise beggar.\n\nAmong freezing landscapes, the film is not only a simplistic vision of uzbek poverty. FaroukÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams, his surreal hallucinations are carried with an enchanting music.\n\nWhen he talks about this film, Khamraev uses humour and sarcasm: Ã‚Â« One day, a producer came and told me : Tomorrow, you start shooting the film Ã‚Â» even if there was already a director who started it! Ã‚Â». Seduced by the story, he did what he was told to and it led to a great film.
