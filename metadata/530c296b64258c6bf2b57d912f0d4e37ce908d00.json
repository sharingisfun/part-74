I &quot;discovered&quot; Donna the Buffalo about three years ago when I stumbled across a review of a show on the internet. I have been a great fan ever since and my enthusiasm for them spread to my wife and two daughters. Donna the Buffalo introduced me to musical forms that I was not real aware of (old time music and zydeco) and now love, as well as some musical instruments you don't normally hear in a rock band (accordion, fiddle, rubboard). &quot;Life's a Ride&quot; was eagerly anticipated by Donna fans and does not disappoint. The songs are excellent but there is a lack of an extended jam that you would hear at a live show. That's really nit-picking though because I love the album. My favorites are &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, &quot;Rockin' Horse&quot;, &quot;Life's a Ride&quot;, and &quot;Everyday&quot;. Check out the album, but see them live if you want a real treat, they particularly shine in the summer festival season.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530c296b64258c6bf2b57d912f0d4e37ce908d00","amp;dn":"Donna+The+Buffalo+-+Life%27s+A+Ride+%5B2005%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530c296b64258c6bf2b57d912f0d4e37ce908d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,12,41,107,100,37,140,107,242,181,125,145,47,13,78,55,206,144,141,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
