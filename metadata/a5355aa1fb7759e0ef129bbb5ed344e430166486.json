Knowing Carroll better than anyone and close with CarrollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-wife, Hardy works closely with an FBI team and soon discovers that Carroll was not only communicating with a network of killers in the outside world, but has much more planned than just a prison escape Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no telling how many additional killers are out there. As Hardy and the FBI team are challenged by the ever-growing web of murder around them, masterminded by the diabolical Carroll, Hardy will not only get a second chance to capture Carroll, but another shot at redemption, as he faces not one but an entire cult of serial killers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5355aa1fb7759e0ef129bbb5ed344e430166486","amp;dn":"The+Following+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5355aa1fb7759e0ef129bbb5ed344e430166486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,53,90,161,251,119,89,224,239,18,155,187,94,211,68,228,48,22,100,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
