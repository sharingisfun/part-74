Since then he's been mainly pursuing a solo career (interrupted by his brief sojourn as a member of Fairground Attraction, on which he collaborated with the similarly inclined British folk-popsters Eddi Reader and Clive Gregson), writing great songs for himself and others and gaining more critical acclaim than commercial success. Thanksgiving finds him wallowing in a soft, billowy, acoustic sadness which is sometimes very pretty in a Beatlesque way (&quot;The Birds Are Leaving&quot;) and sometimes moving (&quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;). On the other hand, it can also be almost excruciating tuneless (the hideous &quot;Swansong&quot;) or eye-rollingly maudlin (the lines &quot;For you this is Thanksgiving/For me, a working day.&quot; That the album title comes from this song is almost unforgivable.). The best moments are the most Beatlesque ones, like the chorus to &quot;Eve.&quot; That fact is a problem in itself, but they really are good moments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2dace9f668f7fd12509068a9e6a011c5aff7a5","amp;dn":"Boo+Hewerdine+-+Thanksgiving+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2dace9f668f7fd12509068a9e6a011c5aff7a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,45,172,233,246,104,247,253,18,80,144,104,169,230,160,17,197,175,247,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
