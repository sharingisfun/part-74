Gordon is heard in prime form, joining a top-notch sextet also including Levy, trumpeter Conte Candoli, trombonist Frank Rosolino, pianist Lou Levy, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar. Excellent bop-based music. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Diggin' For Diz\n02. Ruby My Dear\n03. Tune Up\n04. La Chaloupee (From Tales Of Hoffman)\n05. Day In Day Out\n06. Stanley The Steamer\n07.
