From the third-person narrative of an arrested small-time criminal held on the pavement (Ã¢â‚¬ËœParasol AntsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), to the first-person narrative of an addictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle trying to be clean against the vivid backdrop of BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s State of the Union address (Ã¢â‚¬ËœState of the UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) there are few artists who craft songs so subtly, but with such a huge amount of theatre.\n\nRecorded in his now home city of Buenos Aires, he provides much of the backing himself including acoustic, 12-string, electric and bass guitars, as well as bouzouki and piano. The assembled musicians include Lucy Kaplansky, Lincoln Schliefer, Viktor Krauss, Sarah Milonovich and Brian Mitchell who all bring an array of talents to the songs; notably LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals on Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Juggler Out in TrafficÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Brian MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hammond on Ã¢â‚¬ËœGethsemani GoodbyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœParasol AntsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nHe uses the bouzouki more than ever before on this disc, either on its own, or more often in conjunction with guitars, and it certainly adds an interesting layer to the sound, providing extra rhythm and energy across the album. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also used his voice in different ways, there are some beautiful songs here that are sung with a real gentle touch, and these contrast against the appropriately unsentimental vocals of Ã¢â‚¬ËœState of the UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and the unique delivery of Ã¢â‚¬ËœGet Up ClaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nThe eleven songs here are as a thematically disconnected as you could imagine, rather than as chapters of the same book, think of them as a collection of one authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short stories; where tales of a traveller and his mule in the Roman Empire (Ã¢â‚¬ËœGet up ClaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), rub shoulders with a Balloon seller on the streets of Buenos Aires (Ã¢â‚¬ËœBalloon ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), and crooked land developers in the Southern United States (Ã¢â‚¬ËœOne ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ArkansasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢).\n\nPicking highlights is almost impossible, there are moments in songs that will reach out and hit individuals in different ways; the description of the Balloon ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rig is superb, the sketch of the president in Ã¢â‚¬ËœState of the UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will bring at least a smile to your face (if not a tear to your eye), and the whole atmosphere on Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Juggler Out in TrafficÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is beautifully painted in both lyrics and the arrangement.\n\nNot an artist to be rushed, the wait for Ã¢â‚¬ËœNot Far NowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has been reasonably lengthy, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a price worth paying as the eleven songs are beautifully constructed and presented by one of, if not the finest of all contemporary singer/songwriters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b943ce5e6da98a96e0823fc832d164e019ff149e","amp;dn":"Richard+Shindell+-+Not+Far+Now+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b943ce5e6da98a96e0823fc832d164e019ff149e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,67,206,94,109,169,138,150,224,130,63,200,50,209,100,224,25,255,20,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
