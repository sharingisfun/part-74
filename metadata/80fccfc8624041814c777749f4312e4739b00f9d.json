When the Flood comes, Noah and his family begin life in the Ark, and as the storm rages outside, Noah plays storyteller, waving the tale of Adam and Eve, god and the Serpent through the dark days on the water. Noah's story is told in cell animation. In contrast, the Garden of Eden is hauntingly depicted by the technique of paint on glass.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n   Interactive Menus\n   Original Graphics\n   Film Information\n   Chapters - Direct Scene Access\n   Biography\n   Bible Facts &amp; Trivia\n   Special Collector's Photo Gallery\n\nTestament - Episode 1 - Creation and Flood\nTestament - Episode 2 - Abraham\nTestament - Episode 3 - Moses\nTestament - Episode 4 - Jonah\nTestament - Episode 5 - Ruth\nTestament - Episode 6 - Elijah\nTestament - Episode 7 - Joseph\nTestament - Episode 8 - David &amp; Saul\nTestament - Episode 9 - Daniel\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
