But like Alice tumbling through the rabbit hole, readers will find themselves granted access to an unexpectedly large world, populated with Barnes's daily companions and his chosen ancestors (most of them dead, and quite a few of them French, like Jules Renard, Flaubert, Zola). This is not 'my autobiography,' Barnes emphasizes in this hilariously unsentimental portrait of his family and childhood. Part of what I'm doingÃ¢â‚¬â€which may seem unnecessaryÃ¢â‚¬â€is trying to work out how dead they are. And in this exploration of what remains, the author sifts through unreliable memory to summon up how his ancestorsÃ¢â‚¬â€real and assumedÃ¢â‚¬â€contemplated death and grappled with the perils and pleasures of pit-gazing. If Barnes's self-professed amateur philosophical rambling feels occasionally self-indulgent, his vivid description delights.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c9423852ece3b13422d6aeec0dea97777edd01d","amp;dn":"Nothing+to+Be+Frightened","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c9423852ece3b13422d6aeec0dea97777edd01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,148,35,133,46,206,59,19,66,45,106,238,192,222,169,119,119,237,208,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
