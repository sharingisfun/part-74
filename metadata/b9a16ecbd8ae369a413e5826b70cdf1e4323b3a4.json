What is surprising, though, is that with additives like sugar and artificial flavors, many of these commercial drinks aren't as healthy as they seem. With Cool Waters, it's easy and economical to create one-of-a-kind infusions that are healthier and better-tasting than anything found in stores. Recipes include Pineapple and Lime Seltzer, Pomegranate Flair, Mint Mist, and even flavored ice cubes, and are displayed in beautiful full-color photos that are sure to make readers thirst for a glass of cool water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a16ecbd8ae369a413e5826b70cdf1e4323b3a4","amp;dn":"Cool+Waters%3A+50+Refreshing%2C+Healthy+Homemade+Thirst-Quenchers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a16ecbd8ae369a413e5826b70cdf1e4323b3a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,161,110,203,216,174,54,154,65,62,88,38,183,12,223,30,67,35,179,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
