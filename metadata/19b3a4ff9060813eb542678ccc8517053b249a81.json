For starters their old Nashville label Universal Records South merged with Show Dog-Universal and thus their NY-based Ã¢â‚¬Å“mainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ label Universal Republic moved the group to RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Republic Nashvillle Records division that is part of the Big Machine Label Group. Secondly, the group was allowed a longer time than normal to follow-up their hits Ã¢â‚¬Å“When It Rains,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Radio WavesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Top 11 hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Always The Love Songs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That follow-up, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was recently certified Gold and has sold over 650,000 digital singles to date, a great start for this album, Life At Best.\n\nFrom the first track, a cover of singer/songwriter Will HogeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even If It Breaks Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the title track, the Mike Eli and James Young-penned Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life At BestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ what I hear over the course of this album is a different band than I previously heard on other records. And different is good for while the band doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run from the mainstream, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re most certainly doing their own thing.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Even If It Breaks Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is such a no-brainer of a song for Eli Young Band or any band for that matter that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing that the song (which Hoge co-wrote with EMI Nashville artist Eric Paslay), with such a strong reminder to follow your dreams at any cost, wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cut by any country artists before now.\n\nCurb artist Lee Brice and ace songwriter Liz Rose are the team behind Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and while I can picture Lee singing this song, Mike Eli really puts forth the emotion of a man madly in love with the titular girl. Ã¢â‚¬Å“On My WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a hopeful tune that finds a down on his luck guy who finds a girl who manages to make a guy feel better whenever sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s around him.\n\nLike Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even If It Breaks Your Heart,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SkeletonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a sound of a hit song, a type of song that typified great rock records of days gone by. Written by Mike Eli, James Young and ace songwriter Sean McConnell, the song tells a tale about everyone in the world, about those things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to share and those things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather not tell anyone but the closest of confidants.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for a couple no-doubt-about-it hits on the record, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back-to-back on tracks six and seven. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are the tunes here and both are gigantic tunes for different reasons. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ manages to use analogies for passion as a way to convey a proposal of epic proportions with a chorus of only three words: I love you. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the kind of universal song about how much hard work goes into making your dreams come true, no matter what they are. And as much as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even If It Breaks Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next single, I honestly think now that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ should be the follow-up single to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as it can be applied to any situation in anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, be it the unexpected fight with grief and regret over the loss of a child, a fight with cancer, a relationship, or a job.\n\nIf people are wondering where the Texas Country is in the album, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every Other Memory,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Old ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Son,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“War On A Desperate Man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Each of these songs are singer/songwriter types of tunes and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly what commonly comes from Nashville labels nowadays (though they should be). The latter song features a fantastic, nuanced vocal from Mike Eli. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“RecoverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a moody, rocking melody and a hopeful lyric about remaining optimistic about life while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say GoodnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says something about being truly in love with someone that feels like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready for an epic scene of a film. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something about Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Quickly You ForgetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that recalls classic songs from the 1980s and 1990s with call-and-response parts in the verses and an insanely catchy, vibe-y feel to the melody. If the band and the label were feeling adventurous they could release this tune to radio, otherwise itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make for a fun song for the middle of Eli Young BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic stage show.\n\nWorking with Mike Wrucke once again, Eli Young Band has certainly found their groove as a band and with a sound that makes them easy to identify in the mainstream. Like Zac Brown Band and Sugarland, Eli Young Band writes and records tunes that are uniquely them and that allows them to shape songs that are vibrant and alive.\n\nThis is one of the best records of 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b3a4ff9060813eb542678ccc8517053b249a81","amp;dn":"Eli+Young+Band+-+Life+at+Best+%5B2011%5D+%5BAlbum%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b3a4ff9060813eb542678ccc8517053b249a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,179,164,255,144,96,129,62,181,66,103,140,204,133,23,5,59,36,154,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
