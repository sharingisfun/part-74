That is, he is the one who motivates and enables and energizes your prayer. And when you pray in the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God is &quot;guiding&quot; how you pray and what you pray for. So, to pray in the Holy Spirit is to be moved and guided by the Holy Spirit in prayer. We pray by his power and according to his direction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b5cf1ff59545ce962a9593b474f9253f5d8180","amp;dn":"+Pray+in+the+Holy+Spirit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b5cf1ff59545ce962a9593b474f9253f5d8180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,181,207,31,245,149,69,206,150,42,149,147,180,116,249,37,63,93,129,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
