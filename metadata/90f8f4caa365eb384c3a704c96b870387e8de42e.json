When faced with a devastating diagnosis people must quickly understand the diagnosis, prognosis, and choose from several treatment optionsÃÂ²Ãâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½while still in shock. AfterShock identifies the processes required to respond to a serious diagnosis, regardless of the specific disease.\n\nSocial psychologist Gruman offers practical advice in a 10-stage approach to making clear-headed, informed decisions about who to tell and when; how to get a second opinion or find the right doctor and hospital; where to find reliable online information and telephone help-lines about a particular diagnosis and treatment; how to navigate the health care maze; where to turn for support and comfort.\n\nDr. Gruman not only draws on her expertise in consumer health information and the advice of doctors and nurses, she shares the personal stories of people who have dealt with traumatic diagnoses, including her own experience of having had three different kinds of cancer and a dangerous heart condition. AfterShock is inspiring and empowering, and is an essential companion book to the disease-specific titles that most people with a devastating diagnosis purchase.\n\n                Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it\n\n\nScreen:\n\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAMEhaAek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAMEhaAek&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;      &amp; \n*Comments are always welcome\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nVisit my Thread of Daily Update Uploads:\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f8f4caa365eb384c3a704c96b870387e8de42e","amp;dn":"AfterShock%3AWhat+to+Do+When+the+Doctor+Gives+You-Or+Someone+You+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f8f4caa365eb384c3a704c96b870387e8de42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,248,244,202,163,101,235,56,76,58,112,76,150,184,112,56,126,141,228,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
