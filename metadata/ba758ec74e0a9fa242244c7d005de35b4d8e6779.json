Even if she had time to date, which she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be determined to provide her son with a more secure upbringing than the one she hadÃ¢â‚¬â€and that would mean a husband with big bucks.

She doubts a carefree dreamer like Jack can provide the financial stability she needs.

But Jack needs someone who will fall in love with himÃ¢â‚¬â€not his wealth. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set his sights on Jessie, though her hardened heart just might get in the wayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦To be sure, he conceals his true identity and offers to help Jessie find the rich husband she seeks.

But when she crosses paths with Dean Prescott - the only man she's ever loved - at her brother's wedding, Katie realizes there's a gaping hole in her life. After the ceremony she gets an even bigger surprise when someone abandons a baby girl on her doorstep. Determined to keep the newborn until she learns who her mother is, Katie has her hands full and doesn't need Dean snooping around, especially when his presence stirs feelings she thought were long gone. \n\nDean Prescott knows Katie is lying to him when he discovers a baby is living with her. He shouldn't care what the woman who broke his heart is up to...and he most certainly shouldn't still be aching for her. Yet Dean can't ignore the need to protect Katie - or the desire to be near her every chance he gets. But when he and Katie solve the mystery surrounding the baby, their second chance for happiness could be shattered forever.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba758ec74e0a9fa242244c7d005de35b4d8e6779","amp;dn":"Not+Quite+Series+%281-2%29+by+Catherine+Bybee+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba758ec74e0a9fa242244c7d005de35b4d8e6779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,117,142,199,78,10,159,162,66,36,76,125,0,93,227,91,77,142,103,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
