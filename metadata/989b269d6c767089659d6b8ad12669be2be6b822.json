Many Thanks to all those who had already made a tremendous work creating this one.\n\nThis is most certainly one of Robert Plant's best night ever. The original lacked a little presence and definition, and Robert's voice was often drowned under the rest when it deserved to be loud and clear. In this version you can hear him in all his glory, hope you'll like it.\n\nARTWORK INCLUDED\n\n\nEnjoy !\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyone who has a low generation of Black Sabbath's Hammersmith Odeon 03/13/77 show that he / she is willing to share is welcome to do so.
