Release of this assembly, meanwhile, does not mean that its predecessor lost relevance. \nFor those who prefer to work with assemblies as close as possible to the original distribution, it is still relevant! \nIn developing the same assembly that is presented here, I walked away a little from its principles include the \nreluctance of the foreign application. On this below ...\n\nSo, this assembly includes 9 Russian editions and 9 English editions of Windows 7 SP1 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) kernel:\n\n- Windows 7 Starter SP1 Russian\n- Windows 7 Starter SP1 English\n- Windows 7 Home Basic SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Home Basic SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Home Basic SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Home Basic SP1 x64 English\n- Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x64 English\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64 English\n- Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x86 Russian\n- Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x86 English\n- Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 Russian\n- Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 English\n\nThe efficiency of the assembly as far as possible thoroughly verified.\nAfter installation, you get a fully registered and activated version of Windows 7 chosen modifications.\n\nDue to the fact that during the assembly operation revealed a number of shortcomings associated with \nincorrect operation USB3 drivers from Intel and installing the system under UEFI, assembly of 27 April 2013 \nwas to rebuild the to eliminate these problems. This so-called &quot;silent update&quot; without changing the version \nof the assembly. Those who have already downloaded the release, I offer my sincere apology. But I want to \nnote that if the above shortcomings for you are not critical, then release to swing again for you does not make sense. \nUse the original version!\n\nSome features of the assembly\n\n- The assembly integrates all critical updates available as of April 17, 2013, including Internet Explorer 10.\n- Instead of embedded by default along with the updates Microsoft. NET Firework 4 Client Profile in the assembly \nof integrated light option. NET Framework 4.5 (draft [Slim]. NET Framework 4.5 Full x86/x64).\n- The assembly integrated into Microsoft Visual C + + 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012 Redistributable Package latest versions. \nTo avoid duplicating install different applications earlier versions and redirect programs that require these packages \nto newer versions of libraries, installing older versions locked plugs \n(project [addon] Microsoft Visual C + + 2005-2008-2010-2012 Redistributable Package Hybrid).\n\n- In the assembly of integrated drivers for USB3 following manufacturers and versions: AMD version 1.0.0.0072, \nAsmedia version 1.16.4.0, Etron version 1.00.0000.0115, Fresco Logic version 3.5.97.0, Intel and Renesas \nversion 1.0.8.251 version 2.1.39.0. Integration performed in installer and installed in the OS.\n- At a very early stage of the installation is pre-load a menu where you can select the bit of the primary shell, \nthat is what the loader will be used to install, x86 or x64. Because of this, \nyou should not worry that the 64-bit version of the OS can not stand up for RAID, and that users of 64-bit operating systems \nmay be without service recovery system. For the most inquisitive: Do not attempt to install the 32-bit version of the OS \nfrom the 64-bit boot - the final stage of the installation boot loader will throw an error and refuses to continue the \ninstallation.\n\n- In the System Restore service is triggered from the installation disk, and built into the system, the module is integrated \nMicrosoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) version 7.0, which greatly expands the possibilities of resuscitation system.\n- If during installation you have entered valid license key in the appropriate field, then the system will be activated by this \nswitch to an entirely legitimate. If the field is left blank, will be used for alternative methods of activation.\n- If you are installing on a computer that has a BIOS'e SLIC-table version 2.1 and above, will involve the standard legal (almost) \nthe means of activation, developed by Microsoft for these computers.\n\n- If you do not have a license key and there is no SLIC-table BIOS'e, the system will activate a built-in assembly activator.\n- If you choose to install Windows 7 Ultimate (maximum), then after installation you will be able to switch the interface language \nfrom English to Russian and back standard means Windows 7 Ultimate (maximum). If you have installed any other version that you \ncan use for this purpose utility Vistalizator, a label which is available in the &quot;Start&quot; menu.\n- For technical reasons, the 64-bit version of Windows 7 with this assembly can not be updated for 64-bit version of Windows Vista / 7. \nHowever, there is an opportunity to initiate a so-called Custom installation. When you run the installation from \nDVD / USB-device as a bootable media, it's simple. But to initiate the installation from an already running a 64-bit OS, \nit is not necessary to start a setup.exe in the root directory with the distribution, and through setup.exe, \nwhich is located in the Sources folder distribution.\n\nMore about MSDaRT\nA set of tools Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) to help diagnose and troubleshoot system problems that arise when starting, as well as other problems.\nThe kit includes the following tools:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://foto-pic.ru/img/2013-04/19/o10qwjeormzg6f1a9zyo5hz0s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://foto-pic.ru/img/2013-04/19/o10qwjeormzg6f1a9zyo5hz0s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/1829/therain1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/1829/therain1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/4255/therain2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/4255/therain2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img542/4488/97155557.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img542/4488/97155557.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img401/4651/therain4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img401/4651/therain4.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/4571/therain5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/4571/therain5.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img594/5420/therain6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img594/5420/therain6.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/4765/therain7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/4765/therain7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nInstall Notes :-\n\n1.
