But that doesn't mean you have to turn your back on a great salary, exciting work, and a profession that commands respect.\nJoe Lamacchia is proof. After graduating high school, he said no to collegeÃ¢â‚¬â€and found personal and professional success as the owner of a thriving landscaping company. He also started BlueCollarandProudofIt.com, a resource for people who want to find work in the skilled trades. Blue-collar workers build and maintain our bridges, keep our cars running, fix our plumbing, and provide vital services to every home. That's why Lamacchia calls these 'necessary jobs.' Most blue-collar work simply cannot be outsourced to foreign countries and it's often recession-proof. As Baby Boomers retire, blue-collar industries\nare experiencing workforce shortages because there aren't enough well-trained\npeople to fill all of these jobs. That is, until now . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f7bbe31129f9ef7cb39bf90d5125cb64dd4629","amp;dn":"Blue+Collar+and+Proud+of+It%3A+The+All-in-One+Resource","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f7bbe31129f9ef7cb39bf90d5125cb64dd4629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,247,187,227,17,41,249,239,124,179,155,249,13,81,37,203,100,221,70,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
