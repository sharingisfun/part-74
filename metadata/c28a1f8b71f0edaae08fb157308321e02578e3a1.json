These are the courageous men and women who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running the other way. But the enormous responsibilities of the job also take a personal toll.\n\nWith big reputations and hefty egos, the pressure to perform and make split-second decisions is bound to put squad members at odds. When a tragedy claims one of their own, there's plenty of guilt and blame to go around. In the middle of a divorce, Lt. Matthew Casey tries to go about business as usual, but can't help butting heads with the brash Lt. Kelly Severide of the Rescue Squad - and each blames the other for their fallen team member. When it's &quot;go-time,&quot; though, they put their differences aside and put everything on the line for each other. This is a look inside one of America's noblest professions.\n\nFrom renowned Emmy-winning producer Dick Wolf and the writing team behind &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; comes an edge-of-your-seat view of a dirty job that often means the difference between life and death.\n\nSIZE...........: 1.04 GiB\nRUNTIME........: 42mn 24s\nVIDEO CODEC....: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nRESOLUTION.....: 1280x720\nBITRATE........: 3 055 Kbps\nFRAMERATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO.........2: AC-3 6 384 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c28a1f8b71f0edaae08fb157308321e02578e3a1","amp;dn":"Chicago.Fire.S01E23.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c28a1f8b71f0edaae08fb157308321e02578e3a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,138,31,139,113,240,237,170,224,143,177,87,48,131,33,224,37,120,227,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
