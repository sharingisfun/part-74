When he arrived, he witnessed Spider Widow walk into an ambush by Nazis. The Raven followed them, rescued the girl, and helped her defeat the Germans. They then shared a kiss in the dark with neither seeing the other unmasked. The two heroes became a crime-fighting team and worked with the Phantom Lady on several occasions. Raven could fly and was an agile and skilled fighter. \n\n\n\nSeed for all to enjoy because sharing is caring!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2613215e42356c50c3c27bbba923bd97872ef728","amp;dn":"The+Raven+Quality+Comics+1942+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2613215e42356c50c3c27bbba923bd97872ef728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,19,33,94,66,53,108,80,195,194,123,187,169,35,189,151,135,46,247,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
