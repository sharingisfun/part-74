Little does he know that his passenger has loads more problems than mild hypothermia. It turns out that ex-cat burglar Delta Fox is running for her life. Why and from whom, she doesnÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t know, but the answers lie in her old stomping grounds in L.A. After Brian outmaneuvers the Yakuza in a high-speed car chase, Delta appreciates his talents but resists his offers of help. When the Yakuza threatens his staff, however, Brian insists they team up. So begins their partnership into the L.A. underworld, into a twisted place of murder and seduction, betrayal and revenge. Between her stealth skills, his stunts and their compulsion to watch over each other, they just might survive the hunt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5688576348122ea5a0841f8b15a5a0b5100cac0c","amp;dn":"Fox+Hunt+-+S.M+Stelmack.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5688576348122ea5a0841f8b15a5a0b5100cac0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,136,87,99,72,18,46,165,160,132,31,139,21,165,160,181,16,12,172,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
