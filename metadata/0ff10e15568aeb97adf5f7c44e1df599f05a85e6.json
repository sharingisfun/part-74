Assisted by Slugger Dunn, his ex-prize-fighter valet and best friend, Firebrand used his fighting prowess and skills with a lariat to fight crime. He also has vacuum cups for climbing the buildings in New York. He was engaged to Joan Rogers, a wealthy socialite.\n\nDuring his early adventures, Firebrand was wanted by police for crimes he did not commit. Like many other heroes, he left a signature item wherever he stopped crimes - in his case, it was a lit torch.\n\n\nGolden Age Appearances \n\n    Police Comics #1-13 \n\nNotes\n\n    While the golden age version of Firebrand is public domain, all subsquent versiosn used by DC comics are NOT.
