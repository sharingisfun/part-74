No programming knowledge is necessary to benefit from this book except for the section on Lua bindings, which requires some familiarity with the C programming language. A certain comfort level with command-line operations, text editing, and directory structures is assumed.\nYou need surprisingly little in the way of computer resources to learn and use Lua. This book focuses on Windows and Unix-like (including Linux) systems, but any operating system that supports a command shell should be suitable. You'll need a text editor to prepare and save Lua scripts.\n\nIf you choose to extend Lua with libraries written in a programming language like C, you'll need a suitable software development kit. Many of these kits are freely available on the Internet but, unlike Lua, they can consume prodigious amounts of disk space and memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec0dc2d564d73050d0e8f46a44c5a1a66fc54d1","amp;dn":"Beginning+Lua+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec0dc2d564d73050d0e8f46a44c5a1a66fc54d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,192,220,45,86,77,115,5,13,14,143,70,164,76,90,26,102,252,84,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
