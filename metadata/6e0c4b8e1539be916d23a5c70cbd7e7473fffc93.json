We are now one month from Mageia 3 final release, so your tests - and reports! - are more important than ever.\n\nThis beta release comes with nearly all the designs for Mageia 3 integrated - many thanks to Leo who made the background image for Mageia 2 and then worked again on the Mageia 3 design. Our thanks to him for his patience and for his contribution!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e0c4b8e1539be916d23a5c70cbd7e7473fffc93","amp;dn":"Mageia+3+beta4+x86_64+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e0c4b8e1539be916d23a5c70cbd7e7473fffc93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,12,75,142,21,57,190,145,109,35,165,199,12,189,126,116,115,255,252,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
