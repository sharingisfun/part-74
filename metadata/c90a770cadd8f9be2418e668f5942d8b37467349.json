The word &quot;virtuosos&quot; is intended as much as a warning as a compliment: those with sensitive musical sensibilities might struggle through the lengthy bass solo interludes. Otherwise, this is Scott-Heron at his best, mixing polemic with rare jazzy groove and between-song patter. No one was able to sugar the political pill quite like Gil. &quot;Three Miles Down&quot;, a tribute to the lives of coal miners, might come across as austere and hectoring in some hands but Scott-Heron delivers it sweet. Disappointingly, he doesn't perform his most famous song, &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, his 1970 proto-rap against media airbrushing of the underprivileged, which establishes him as the missing link between 1960s black jazz radicalism and Public Enemy. However, he does perform &quot;Johannesburg&quot;, bristling with new relevance with Nelson Mandela having been released from jail just weeks prior to this performance, and ends with the at once rousing and despairing &quot;The Bottle&quot;, his lament for alcoholism, whose languorous, flute-driven funk earned him fresh popularity in the 80s.
