The first incarnation of the group was formed, by Tracii Guns, in 1983 but disbanded in 1985 following its merger with fellow Los Angeles group Hollywood Rose, becoming the first lineup of Guns N' Roses. The same year, the group was reformed by Guns and singer Paul Black adding Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Black would soon be replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels was added to the group. Later, Alexander would be replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with this being known as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of L.A. Guns. They achieved moderate chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the group went through numerous lineup changes (with Guns being the only consistent member) and failed to regain mainstream attention.\n\nThe &quot;classic lineup&quot; of the group would reunite in 1999 and began recording new material. However, the group continued to change lineups and Guns eventually left to form the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx of MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e in 2002. L.A. Guns continued without Guns, bringing in guitarist Stacey Blades, however, following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus in 2006, Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band. The group's lineup consisted of former L.A. Guns members Black, Alexander as well as Jeremy Guns (though the lineup would eventually change), with the group eventually changing their name to L.A. Guns. Both groups continued to record and tour under the L.A. Guns moniker until 2012, when the Tracii Guns led version of the group disbanded.\n\nTo date, L.A. Guns have released ten studio albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ L.A. Guns (1988); Cocked &amp; Loaded (1989); Hollywood Vampires (1991); Vicious Circle (1995); American Hardcore (1996); Shrinking Violet (1999); Man in the Moon (2001); Waking the Dead (2002); Tales from the Strip (2005); and Hollywood Forever (2012), two extended plays Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cuts (1992); Wasted (1998) as well as a number of live and compilation albums.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHollywood Forever is an album by the Phil Lewis-fronted version of L.A. Guns. The album is produced by Andy Johns, and is on Cleopatra Records. The album is available as a CD, vinyl record and digital download.\n\nEarly work, including pre-production and songwriting, on the album began in late 2011, with recording beginning in early 2012 in Los Angeles. The album title was chosen by Phil Lewis to express the band's connection to the Los Angeles area in general and Hollywood in particular.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fce1b720541e653f0542277c99da6d4682a1e3e7","amp;dn":"L.A.+Guns+-+Hollywood+Forever+%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fce1b720541e653f0542277c99da6d4682a1e3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,225,183,32,84,30,101,63,5,66,39,124,153,218,109,70,130,161,227,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
