The date's got a nicely rough-edged feel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but really avoids any of the bluesy cliches that could sometimes creep in when players like this hit the French scene. And instead, there's a sprightly modern feel to the music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a mixture of Art's hard-yet-lyrical piano lines with the guitar of Terry Donahue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ supported by the great rhythm team of Bill Crow on bass and Dave Bailey on drums!\nSimmons has a very rhythmic approach to playing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ maybe one of the best of the 50s generation to work in the style Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include &quot;Art's Blues&quot;, &quot;Homage To Neal Hefti&quot;, &quot;The Lady Is A Tramp&quot;, and &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot;. CD also features 8 more bonus tracks from the same time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ featuring the same group, but with vocals from Bertrice Reading Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on cuts that include &quot;Love For Sale&quot;, &quot;No More In Life&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, and &quot;Left Bank Blues&quot;.\n\nTrack list:\n01.
