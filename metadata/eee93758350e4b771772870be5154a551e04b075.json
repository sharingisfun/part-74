On April 12, 1995, two weeks after her death, George W. Bush, governor of Texas at the time, declared her birthday &quot;Selena Day&quot; in Texas. Warner Bros. produced Selena, a film based on her life starring Jennifer Lopez, in 1997. Selena's life was also the basis of the musical &quot;Selena Forever&quot; starring Veronica Vazquez as Selena. In June 2006 Selena was commemorated with a life-sized bronze statue (Mirador de la Flor in Corpus Christi, Texas) and a Selena museum opened there. \n  \n   She was named the &quot;top Latin artist of the '90s&quot; and &quot;Best selling Latin artist of the decade&quot; by Billboard for her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits. Selena had the most successful singles of 1994 and 1995, &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; and &quot;No Me Queda MÃƒÂ¡s&quot;. She was called &quot;The Queen of Tejano music&quot; and the Mexican equivalent of Madonna. Selena released her first album, &quot;Selena y Los Dinos&quot;, at the age of twelve. She won Female Vocalist of the Year at the 1987 Tejano Music Awards and landed a recording contract with EMI a few years later. Her fame grew throughout the early 1990s, especially in Spanish-speaking countries, and she had begun recording in English as well.She has sold over 60 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. She is also the only female artist to have five albums in U.S. Billboard 200 at the same time   \n\n\n\nand this is our world without wars, without violence and with a lot of music,love and happiness\n\n\n           RONAN KEATING -  Life Is A Rollercoaster (2000)\n\n\n\nThank you all my friends from Pirate Bay, especialy  Tom,dehou,mygtho for joining me in celebrating my 500th \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee93758350e4b771772870be5154a551e04b075","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+500","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee93758350e4b771772870be5154a551e04b075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,233,55,88,53,14,75,119,23,114,135,11,229,21,74,85,30,4,176,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
