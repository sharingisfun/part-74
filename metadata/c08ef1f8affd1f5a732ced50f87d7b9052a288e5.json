Atlantic honcho Jerry Wexler had signed Dickinson and the Dixie Flyers, the label's house band for nearly all its soul recordings at the time, to record an album. Only Dickinson really felt up to it, and Dixie Fried was the result. Mixing blues, country, and unapologetic Southern boogie on nine tunes, Dickinson sounded something like a not-yet-formed Leon Russell or Dr. John (the latter of whom played on the album extensively). His wild, eclectic choice of songs makes for a mixed bag in the end. The sheer barrelhouse abandon of &quot;Wine&quot; is surpassed only by the New Orleans-style R&amp;B of the title track, or the carnival-barker anthem &quot;O How She Dances,&quot; a strange and fascinating precursor to Tom Waits' signature style. On Bob Dylan's &quot;John Brown&quot; Dickinson loses his way a bit, and his voice (at once hesitant and overzealous) trips him up in a number of places throughout. A gem to be sure, but one of a very rough cut indeed, and of course this factor may hold special appeal to some listeners. But understandably, Dickinsonstuck to producing for a while after this one. [Sepia Tone's 2002 release is the first time this album has ever been issued on compact disc.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08ef1f8affd1f5a732ced50f87d7b9052a288e5","amp;dn":"James+Luther+Dickinson+-+Dixie+Fried+%5B1972%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08ef1f8affd1f5a732ced50f87d7b9052a288e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,142,241,248,175,253,31,90,115,44,237,80,248,125,123,144,82,162,136,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
