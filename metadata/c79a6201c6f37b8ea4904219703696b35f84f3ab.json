Jack Cole. Twenty years ago they were good buddies but horrors have changed them both. Lindsay lost her entire family except for her niece in a car accident, and Jack was held captive in New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underbelly for nearly two years by demented sub-humans. It was a soul-sucking experience thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left him a shell of a man. He refuses to descend into that hell again, especially for a girl whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably dead anyway. But when Lindsay is nearly killed there after going it alone, Jack feels compelled to save her skin. Jack navigates Lindsay through a strange territory, populated with the eccentric, the insane and the desperate. Each encounter takes them closer to LindsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s niece but also closer into the clutches of the mad creatures that will enslave them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79a6201c6f37b8ea4904219703696b35f84f3ab","amp;dn":"Undertow+-+SM+Stelmack_epub.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79a6201c6f37b8ea4904219703696b35f84f3ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,154,98,1,198,243,123,142,164,144,66,25,112,54,150,179,95,132,243,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
