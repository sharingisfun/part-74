But what if, instead of having been founded 50 books ago, Hard Case Crime had been founded 50 years ago, by a rascal out to make a quick buck off the popularity of pulp fiction? Such a fellow might make a few enemies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially after publishing a supposed non-fiction account of a heist at a Mob-run nightclub, actually penned by an 18-year-old showgirl. With both the cops and the crooks after them, our heroes are about to learn that reading and writing pulp novels is a lot more fun than living them... \n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nHigh-speed action and nonstop thrills highlight the 50th novel from Hard Case Crime, penned by publisher and Edgar-winning writer Ardai (The Good-Neighbor Policy). Smalltown girl Trixie becomes a dancer in a New York nightclub in the 1950s and decides to write about the dirty side of the business. When her tell-all becomes a sensation, mob boss Sal Nicolazzo threatens the publisher, demanding to know who committed the heist chronicled in the book. Trixie's fiction is mirrored by fact, and $3 million of mobster money is missing. With time running out and lives on the line, Trixie races to discover the truth. Ardai sets an impressive standard for the new wave of pulp crime fiction. With good girls, bad girls, mob kings and grifters, suspense is guaranteed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e6f3a0103176c5b3901bd99db9e2555b4139630","amp;dn":"Charles+Ardai+-+Fifty-to-One+-+ePub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e6f3a0103176c5b3901bd99db9e2555b4139630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,111,58,1,3,23,108,91,57,1,189,153,219,158,37,85,180,19,150,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
