He was born on a military base in Berlin on 29 October 1960. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he served 13 years in the Military Police, during which time he became part of a fictional military police unit, the 110th Special Investigations Unit, formed to handle exceptionally tough cases, especially those involving members of the U.S. Army Special Forces.\nThough he was demoted from Major to Captain in the prequel novel The Enemy, he regained his rank by the time he mustered out in 1997. He received many military awards during his career, including the Silver Star, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier's Medal, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in the bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983.[citation needed]\nSince leaving the Army, Reacher has been a drifter. He wanders throughout the U.S. because he was accustomed to being told where to go, when to go and what to do for every day of his life from military childhood to military adulthood. He also felt he never got to know his own country, having spent much of his youth living overseas on military bases and at West Point. He usually travels by hitchhiking or bus. As a drifter, the only possessions he carries are money, a foldable toothbrush and, after 9/11, an expired passport and an ATM debit card.\n\nJack Reacher's Rules by Lee Child (November 12th 2012) *Not A Novel*\n\nSecond Son (Jack Reacher 0.1) by Lee Child (August 15th 2011)\n\nKilling Floor (Jack Reacher #1) by Lee Child (April 25th 2006)\n\nDie Trying (Jack Reacher #2) by Lee Child (October 28th 2008)\n\nTripwire (Jack Reacher #3) by Lee Child (July 1st 2000)\n\nRunning Blind (Jack Reacher #4) by Lee Child (July 1st 2001)\n\nEcho Burning (Jack Reacher #5) by Lee Child (April 30th 2002)\n\nWithout Fail (Jack Reacher #6) by Lee Child (May 17th 2002)\n\nPersuader (Jack Reacher #7) by Lee Child (March 25th 2008)\n\nThe Enemy (Jack Reacher # by Lee Child (April 26th 2005)\n\nOne Shot (Jack Reacher #9) by Lee Child (March 24th 2009)\n\nThe Hard Way (Jack Reacher #10) by Lee Child (March 16th 2006)\n\nBad Luck and Trouble (Jack Reacher #11) by Lee Child (May 15th 2007)\n\nNothing to Lose (Jack Reacher #12) by Lee Child (June 3rd 2008)\n\nGone Tomorrow (Jack Reacher #13) by Lee Child (April 1st 2009)\n\n61 Hours (Jack Reacher #14) by Lee Child (May 18th 2010)\n\nWorth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) by Lee Child (October 19th 2010)\n\nThe Affair (Jack Reacher #16) by Lee Child (September 29th 2011)\n\nDeep Down (Jack Reacher #16.5) by Lee Child (July 16th 2012)\n\nA Wanted Man (Jack Reacher #17) by Lee Child (September 25th 2012)\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49c2fd201d8827ba4dafc54598931cfb1627ad5","amp;dn":"Jack+Reacher+Series+%280.1-17%29+by+Lee+Child+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49c2fd201d8827ba4dafc54598931cfb1627ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,156,47,210,1,216,130,123,164,218,252,84,89,137,49,207,177,98,122,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
