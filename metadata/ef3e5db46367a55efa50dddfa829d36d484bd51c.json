He must join the High Guard as they try to rid the lands of the Legion of the Fallen. With swords and sorcery, Drake must fight his way through 5 distinct realms. From the spires of the Citadel to the murky depths of Duskwood Drake will run, jump, duck, fight and cast spells as he becomes ever more powerful and must eventually challenge the leader of the dead army himself.\n\nI am not the original uploader \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3e5db46367a55efa50dddfa829d36d484bd51c","amp;dn":"Crusaders+Of+Might+And+Magic+full+working+%28english+version+plus+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3e5db46367a55efa50dddfa829d36d484bd51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,62,93,180,99,103,165,94,250,80,221,223,168,41,211,109,72,75,213,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
