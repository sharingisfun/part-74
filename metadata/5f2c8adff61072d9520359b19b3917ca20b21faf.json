In the face of the German onslaught, Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara made a decision that would change his life, and thousands of others. With no possible hope for reward, and at great risk to his family and career, Sugihara acted on his innermost beliefs, and used his diplomatic power to rescue desperate Jewish refugees. This is something that the largely Jewish financiers of many wars, would have never dreamed of.\n\nAs Japanese Consul to Lithuania, Sugihara defied Tokyo authorities by writing transit visas that were the sole remaining hope of Jews facing the fear of extermination. More than 2,000 Sugihara visas allowed hundreds of families to flee Europe through Russia to Japan, and safe havens abroad. Today it is estimated that at least 40,000 people owe their existence to Sugihara's heroism.\n\nThrough unprecedented access to Sugihara's family, and their personal home movies, photos, and papers, and interviews with Sugihara survivors, and their descendants, viewers will discover an inspiring, little-known story of personal courage, sacrifice, and dedication.\n\n(Decrypted) NTSC DVD5 (Runtime: 82m)\n\nIt is too bad that some of the refugees made complete hypocrites of themselves, by driving out almost one million Palestinians from their ancestral homeland during the 1948 catastrophe, or Naqba, which the zionist israelis commemorate as independence day. The same Palestinians who are the most direct descendants of the original Semitic peoples who have always lived there, some of whom were Jews, Hebrews, Aramaic, etc.\n\nRegardless of Jews' preoccupation with their own suffering, and the regular exaggeration of it as somehow exclusive, through endless media brainwash, which is used to excuse the theft of Palestine, and that brow-beats Germans and Europeans mostly, but also the Japanese people, with the excusing of atomic bombings (ie: that they actually saved lives!! You gotta be retarded to believe that) -- this documentary is quite factual, and the story is absolutely amazing. Chiune Sugihara is a true HERO who went unrecognized, and was even shunned for his good works, for most of his life.\n\n&quot;In life, do what's right, because it's right, and leave it alone. No ulterior motive. Do what is right. Don't make money from it. Don't write an article about it. Don't publicize it. Do what's right, because it's right.&quot; ~ Chiune Sugihara\n\nTo all those who would leave hare-brained comments: &quot;nazi&quot; Dutchman cries when he hears about Jews being saved from bloodthirsty Lithuanians. Even a German helped. \n\nChiune Sugihara is survived by his loving family:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ybg0hig77&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ybg0hig77&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4t68x7iqp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4t68x7iqp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yh4wieaon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yh4wieaon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a6q3z16ld&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a6q3z16ld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/shlqshfa9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/shlqshfa9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/f38mkj21v&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/f38mkj21v&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/pr3trs8hr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/pr3trs8hr&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2c8adff61072d9520359b19b3917ca20b21faf","amp;dn":"SUGiHARA+%E2%98%AE+Conspiracy+of+Kindness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2c8adff61072d9520359b19b3917ca20b21faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,44,138,223,246,16,114,217,82,3,89,177,155,57,23,202,32,178,31,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
