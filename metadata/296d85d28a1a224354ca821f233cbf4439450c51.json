A top mob boss, a reputed consigliere, and other high-profile members of the Chicago Outfit were accused in a total of eighteen gangland killings, revealing organized crimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruthless grip on the city throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\n            Painting a vivid picture of murder, courtroom drama, family loyalties and disloyalties, journalist Jeff Coen accurately portrays the Chicago OutfitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cold-blooded--and sometimes incompetent--killers and their crimes in the case that brought them down. In 1998 Frank Calabrese Jr. volunteered to wear a wire to gather evidence against his father, a vicious loan shark who strangled most of his victims with a rope before slitting their throats to ensure they were dead. Frank Jr. went after his uncle Nick as well, a calculating but sometimes bumbling hit man who would become one of the highest-ranking turncoats in mob history, admitting he helped strangle, stab, shoot, and bomb victims who got in the mobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way, and turning evidence against his brother Frank.\n            The Chicago courtroom took on the look and feel of a movie set as ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most colorful mobsters and their equally flamboyant attorneys paraded through and performed: James Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jimmy LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Marcello, the acting head of the Chicago mob; Joey Ã¢â‚¬Å“the ClownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lombardo, one of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most eccentric mobsters; Paul Ã¢â‚¬Å“the IndianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Schiro; and a former Chicago police officer, Anthony Ã¢â‚¬Å“TwanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Doyle, among others.\n            Re-creating events from court transcripts, police records, interviews, and notes taken day after day as the story unfolded in court, Coen provides a riveting wide-angle view and one of the best accounts on record of the inner workings of the Chicago syndicate and its control over the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streets.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Family-Secrets-Case-Crippled-Chicago/dp/1569765456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367692239&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=family+secrets+chicago&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Family-Secrets-Case-Crippled-Chicago/dp/1569765456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367692239&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=family+secrets+chicago&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296d85d28a1a224354ca821f233cbf4439450c51","amp;dn":"Family+Secrets%3A+The+Case+That+Crippled+the+Chicago+Mob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296d85d28a1a224354ca821f233cbf4439450c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,109,133,210,138,26,34,67,84,202,130,31,35,60,191,68,57,69,12,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
