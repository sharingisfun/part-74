Only one woman would dare to protect humanity from the wrath of such strange and powerful forces. But is she one of us--or one of them?  This torrent contains the first three story arcs:  Blood, Guts, and Iron.\n\nHippolyta, queen of the Amazons, has kept a secret from her daughter all her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€œand when Wonder Woman learns who her father is, her life will shatter like brittle clay. The only one more shocked than Diana by this revelation? Bloodthirsty HeraÃ¢â‚¬â€œso why is her sinister daughter, Strife, so eager for the truth to be told?\n\nWonder Woman goes to hell! After playing Posidon, Hades, and Hera against each other, Hades strikes back by kidnapping Zola and trapping her in the Underworld. It's up to Wonder Woman--with a little help from the God of Love and the God of Smiths--to break Zola out. But what is Hades' real game, and once you get into the land of the dead, how exactly do you get out?\n\nWonder Woman has finally discovered her heritage, as well as all the family that comes along with it. However, as she digs deeper into her familial tree, there's as many Gods that are willing to lend her a hand as there are those that would do her harm. WW continues on her search for her friend Zola's baby, not knowing who she can trust. So when she discovers New God Orion at her doorstep, is he here to help her--or destroy her?\n\nThanks goes to Avalon and Shining Knight for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48f5976da233d3f05e6ca346d4be8270992e6bc","amp;dn":"Wonder+Woman+v4+0-17+%282011-2013%29+%28Avalon-SCC-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48f5976da233d3f05e6ca346d4be8270992e6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,143,89,118,218,35,61,63,5,230,202,52,109,75,232,39,9,146,230,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
