I Love The Way\n\n\nAlbum Notes\n&quot;Yarn sums up perfectly both band and album, neither pretends to be anything other than a trawl through some good old fashioned country music. Almost as if to prove the point, in 25 Years there's a shooting over a woman and what's more country than that? \n\nIt's all too easy to dismiss the gentleness and homespun whimsy of Dear Mama, I'm Sorry as weaknesses, in fact they are immovable strengths and go to the heart of the album, Yarn has simple stories to tell and is determined to tell them its way. \n\nWhat the band really achieve here is to show just how beautiful songs can be, whether it's the delicate reflection of Angel Of Woodstock, the honest joy of Cat And Mouse or the heartbreakingly translucent Madeline, Yarn finds the prefect setting for its own music. \n\nBut Yarn are not some pale shadow of a country band, there's a zest behind Bad Bad Man and equally real sentiment to Tennessee, an album that is traditional in style certainly isn't tired or dated in content. \n\nHowever, like most bands worth the name, Yarn has added its own signature to a genre you think you know intimately.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42fccbe4198ff21c04d69e11c426279ab04d5f4f","amp;dn":"Yarn+-+Yarn+%5B2007%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42fccbe4198ff21c04d69e11c426279ab04d5f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,252,203,228,25,143,242,28,4,214,158,17,196,38,39,154,176,77,95,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
