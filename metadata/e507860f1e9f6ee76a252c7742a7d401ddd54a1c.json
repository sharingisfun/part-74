Being a rather short and experimental project, it's suitable for those who usually don't play as much and/or have little spare time, even though we think The Plan will appeal to a wide range of people as well. If the people want it, and Steam allows it, we want The Plan to be released completely for free.\n\nThe game has been developed by Krillbite Studio, as a side project for the last 6 months while we're working on our bigger project Among the Sleep. The score was recorded by Naxos International and performed by Oslo Camerata.
