Only the Electric Flag's &quot;Groovin' Is Easy,&quot; the Rip Chords' &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot; and Al Kooper's take on &quot;The Weight&quot; aren't regularly heard on the radio. The rest -- &quot;Time Has Come Today,&quot; &quot;Down in the Boondocks,&quot; &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,&quot; &quot;Kicks,&quot; &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35,&quot; &quot;Spinning Wheel,&quot; &quot;Evil Ways,&quot; &quot;Piece of My Heart,&quot; &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot; -- are all in heavy rotation, which is what makes this a good choice for oldies fans who want a hard copy of these tunes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rock-classics-of-the-60s-r23674&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rock-classics-of-the-60s-r23674&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002Z1O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002Z1O&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD Universe's page: \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
