Coppola, working once again with the author Mario Puzo, crafts two interwoven stories that work as both prequel and sequel to the original. One shows the humble Sicilian beginnings and New York rise of a young Don Vito, not played in an Oscar-winning performance for Best Supporting Actor by Robert De Niro. The other shows the ascent of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new Don. Reassembling many of the cast member who help make The Godfather, Coppola has produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision, the film received eleven Academy Awards nominations, winning six including Best Picture of 1974.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio Commentary by Francis Ford Coppola\n\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
