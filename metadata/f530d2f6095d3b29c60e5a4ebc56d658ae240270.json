It is also noted that the charge attack has been added to the Great Sword, something the PS2 version did not have. \n\nNew Content:\n\nCompletely new additions and features:\n\n    Monster color variations and sizes\n    New skill system that was operated by numbers rather than armor\n    New &quot;G&quot; rank quests\n    Hire Felyne chefs to cook stat-boosting (or lowering) meals\n    Kokoto Farm, to acquire materials within the village\n    Training School\n    New sharpness levels: Blue and White\n\n----\n\nIf you like this game, please support the developers and buy the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f530d2f6095d3b29c60e5a4ebc56d658ae240270","amp;dn":"Monster+Hunter+G+Wii+%28NTSC-J%29-Nargacuga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f530d2f6095d3b29c60e5a4ebc56d658ae240270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,48,210,246,9,93,59,41,198,14,90,78,188,86,214,88,174,36,2,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
