Give it a try, the story's starting to pick up steam! I like it.  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nIn the 21st century, technology can defend us from anything: terrorist attacks, mad science, even alien invasions. But how do we protect ourselves from a full-blown invasion of magic?\n\nCredits\nWriter: John Rogers\nArt &amp; Colors: Todd Harris\nLettering: Troy Peteri\n\n------\n\nJohn Rogers\n\nJohn Rogers' 16-year career is built on successes in numerous media. He's written and produced a wide range of television series including COSBY and JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES; most recently he co-created the hit caper series LEVERAGE for TNT. His film work includes over twenty scripts and rewrites including THE CORE and TRANSFORMERS. John has also worked in role-playing games and comics; his relaunch of BLUE BEETLE with Keith Giffen was critically acclaimed and a fan favorite. He's currently running the fifth season of LEVERAGE and is developing several online projects. In case the entertainment business falls through, John has a Physics degree to fall back on.\n\nTodd Harris\n\nStoryboards, graphic design, concept paintings, comic book art ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ Todd Harris has worked on many of the most popular films, games, and commercials of the last decade. His credits include: X Men Origins: Wolverine, God of War II &amp; III, In Time, Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, and the upcoming After Earth.\n\n------\n\nTHRILLBENT is a digital comics site created by award-winning comics writer Mark Waid and television writer/producer extraordinaire John Rogers.\n\nIt is an experiment in new-media publishing. Nothing about it is carved in stone; the site will change and evolve with the help of your feedback and constructive criticism. There will be glorious successes, there will be crashing failures, but most of all, there will be the courage to challenge 75 years' worth of accepted &quot;rules&quot; about what comics are and aren't.\n\nThis is NOT an attempt to &quot;kill print.&quot; Mark, John and their collaborators all love print comics. Mark alone writes what seems to be about one out of every three published these days. Print and digital can co-exist; we're just trying to level the playing field between the two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660f76caf32d4f3c10ac56aa7f400406634e9d74","amp;dn":"ARCANUM+01-06+%282013%29+%28Thrillbent%29+%28digital+exclusive%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660f76caf32d4f3c10ac56aa7f400406634e9d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,15,118,202,243,45,79,60,16,172,86,170,127,64,4,6,99,78,157,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
