Edge is a Mecca for games journalists, featuring contributions from the leading writers across every format, and includes famously expert and honest reviews, all the latest news, fascinating insights and views from within the games industry and features on the nature of gaming as a whole. Beautifully designed and produced, Edge is a must for any gamer. A consistent purveyor of fine covers, to boot.\n\nEdge UK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ June 2013\nEnglish | 148 pages | HQ PDF | 97.00 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44a8b1dbe7aafed85fdecbfe449065833b9740a","amp;dn":"Edge+UK+%26ndash%3B+June+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44a8b1dbe7aafed85fdecbfe449065833b9740a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,74,139,29,190,122,175,237,133,253,236,191,228,73,6,88,51,185,116,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
