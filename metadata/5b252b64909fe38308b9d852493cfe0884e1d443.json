The built-in rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to add their own rules to target any language in any text file.\nAs a project or company grows, managing code standards throughout your team becomes virtually impossible. Consistent code is crucial to future development and maintenance.
