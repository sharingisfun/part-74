This is still a very early version, so locks and unlocks are going to have to be manual, but alas, I am working on a version where you will just give access to a certain process (eg. C:\\program filesbitcoin.exe).\n\nSo I present you with the first official version:\n\nCurrent version :\nGo to settings and select either searched files (by default containing the word &quot;wallet&quot;) or manually add a file. Note that searched file keywords can be changed and then hit re-scan.\n\nOnce you have files in the watched column, save and then tick them in the main screen to have them blocked. To unblock, just un-tick the box. Fairly straight forward for now, but lots of functionality coming in future releases\n\nThis is still technically a Alpha version so for any errors, suggestions or enhancements, please either PM me here or send a mail to me : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9dfff4e9fef2f4f3ddeee4eee9f8f0e9f8fef5b3fef2b3e7fc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; (yes we have developers here in South Africa)\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b276df3cea2682b89d19a776d675c1b7727d36b","amp;dn":"Safe+Wallet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b276df3cea2682b89d19a776d675c1b7727d36b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,39,109,243,206,162,104,43,137,209,154,119,109,103,92,27,119,39,211,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
