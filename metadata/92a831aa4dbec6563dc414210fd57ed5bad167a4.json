But his debts in his hometown are many and long overdue, the townspeople are tough as nails, and he soon gets more than he expected from the quiet village. In this dark comedy, his third feature, writer-director Jamshed Usmonov cast the population of Asht as its own persuasive self and his own mother and brother as the fractured yet formidable domestic couple.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a831aa4dbec6563dc414210fd57ed5bad167a4","amp;dn":"Angel+on+the+Right+%28%D0%A4%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B8+%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%84%D0%B8+%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%29+%5B2002%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a831aa4dbec6563dc414210fd57ed5bad167a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,168,49,170,77,190,198,86,61,196,20,33,15,213,126,213,186,209,103,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
