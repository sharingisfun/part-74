Each week features a different themeÃ¢â‚¬â€from &quot;Greek Mythology&quot; to &quot;Words from Film&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and at the end of the week, Garg sends out a newsletter with enthusiastic feedback from the more than half-million AWAD subscribers around the world.\n\nInspired by his wildly popular Web site, Garg's first book, A Word A Day, became a national bestseller. Now, he presents a fitting encore: Another Word A Day is the second in a series of books in celebration of the English language, featuring words of all kindsÃ¢â‚¬â€unusual, unfamiliar, intriguing, exoticÃ¢â‚¬â€that are in use today. Garg offers fifty-two delightful chapters grouped by theme, ranging from &quot;Words to Describe People,&quot; &quot;Toponyms,&quot; and &quot;Words Borrowed from Yiddish&quot; to &quot;False Friends,&quot; &quot;Words That Aren't What They Appear to Be,&quot; and much more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c92f41f79605c72d6b0f1062ca796c3b39ef287","amp;dn":"Another+Word+A+Day%2C+Limited+Gift+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c92f41f79605c72d6b0f1062ca796c3b39ef287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,146,244,31,121,96,92,114,214,176,241,6,44,167,150,195,179,158,242,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
