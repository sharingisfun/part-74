After lending his voice to a skit on The Slim Shady LP, a dispute between Eminem and Aristotle led to the break-up of the working relationship. From the Marshall Mathers LP onwards, all skits using the Ken Kaniff persona have been performed by Eminem, not Aristotle - usually in an attempt to poke fun.\n\nAristotle struck back with a full-length album titled &quot;The Ken Kaniff Show&quot;, which was independently released online at http://www.kenkaniff.com\n\nOn the album Aristotle alternates between his Ken Kaniff voice and his regular rapping style. The album features diss tracks against Eminem and contains controversial songs about topics as diverse as paedophilia, masturbation, gangsterism and is at times sadistic and humourous.The album's site is no longer in operation and little has been heard from Aristotle since.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3942b3f246b58661ff2bb1f0b54199a246067b","amp;dn":"The+Ken+Kaniff+Show+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3942b3f246b58661ff2bb1f0b54199a246067b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,57,66,179,242,70,181,134,97,255,43,177,240,181,65,153,162,70,6,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
