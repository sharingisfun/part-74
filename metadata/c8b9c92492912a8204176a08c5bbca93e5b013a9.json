Despite being polar opposites, Andy and Paul are passionate and totally committed to each other. But when the two-year itch infects their relationship, Paul becomes distant and refuses to talk about it. Paul is the love of Andy's life and he'll do anything to make him happy, even if it means bringing another man into their bed. But is it really the answer? Or will it drive them further apart?\n\nZach flees to Los Angeles to escape his abusive father. He plans to use his good looks to get into the film industry but catching that big break is harder than he thought. He decides to try his luck in San Francisco. He has no money but if he can find someone to put a roof over his head, he'll trade sex for security. When two smokin' hot guys pick him up on the Pacific Coast Highway, he thinks he hit pay dirt. He never expected to actually fall for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8b9c92492912a8204176a08c5bbca93e5b013a9","amp;dn":"Sleepless+Knights+by+Gale+Stanley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8b9c92492912a8204176a08c5bbca93e5b013a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,185,201,36,146,145,42,130,4,23,106,8,197,187,202,147,229,176,19,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
