Over 2 million players! Ice Rage brings ice hockey into the 21st century, whilst paying tribute to 1984Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Hat Trick. Players face off across a ice rink, in a hockey duel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one player and one keeper one each side. \n\nPlay is rapid and rough, with players spending as much time eating the ice as on their feet. There are three different single player modes (Tournament, Quick Match and Deathmatch) and a single-device multiplayer. There are also tons of unique characters to choose from such as lightning fast Antero or heavy-hitting Enviro-Bear. \n\nTeam them up with crazy goalies like Santa and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sure to get the upper hand. Superb animation and charismatic characters make this a game you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget in a hurry. We dare you to take on the championship or challenge your friend in the most intense single-device multiplayer you've ever experienced.\n\n- Music and sound FX from the audio designer of Alan Wake &amp; Max Payne.\n- Single-device multiplayer for 2 people\n- Awesome 3D graphics\n- Tournament mode: Can you defeat the legendary Skar?\n- Over 2 million players canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be wrong!\n- The best single-player Hockey game around.\n\nWhat's in this version:\n1.0.3\n- &quot;Sticky joystick&quot; bug fixed\n1.0.2\n- Meet the 4 new characters in this update.\n- With Gebetto-cat, Ninja, Lumberjack and Skeleton your teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna make the ice melt!\n1.0.1\n- Joypad is now set by default\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.game.icerage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.game.icerage&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec51e3c26094822384beceb2860a6a1e112fc7f","amp;dn":"Ice+Rage+v1.0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec51e3c26094822384beceb2860a6a1e112fc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,197,30,60,38,9,72,34,56,75,236,235,40,96,166,161,225,18,252,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
