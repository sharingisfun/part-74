Supplying irrefutable evidence of Nolan's directorial bravura, Following is the fragmented tale of an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London, hoping that they will provide inspiration for his first novel. He gets more than he bargained for with one of his unwitting subjects, who leads him down a dark, criminal path. With gritty aesthetics and a made-on-the-fly vibe (many shots were simply stolen on the streets, unbeknownst to passersby), Following is a mind-bending psychological journey that shows the remarkable beginnings of one of today's most acclaimed filmmakers.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio Commentary By Christopher Nolan\nNew Interview With Christopher Nolan\nChronological Edit Of The Film\nSide-By-Side Comparison Of The shooting Scripts With Three Scenes From The Film\nDoodlebug (1997) Three Minute Film By Nolan, Starring Following's Jeremy Theobald\nTrailers\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
