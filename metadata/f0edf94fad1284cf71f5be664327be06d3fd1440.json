Clark \nFormat: MP3 \n\nIt's a classic case of mistaken identity. But this time, it's no mistake. \nPlans go hilariously and seductively awry when mild-mannered Audrey Thompson dresses as Ava, her flamboyant but cowardly twin. It is Audrey's task, as Ava, to break up with Ava's fiancÃƒÂ©, Zach Banister. However, as Audrey is stuffing her bra and tottering around in her sister's stilettos, she falls for Zach instead. Little does she know Zach has an agenda all his own.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0edf94fad1284cf71f5be664327be06d3fd1440","amp;dn":"Borrowed+Stilettos+by+Rebecca+J.+Clark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0edf94fad1284cf71f5be664327be06d3fd1440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,237,249,79,173,18,132,207,113,245,190,102,67,39,190,6,211,253,20,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
