And while there is a natural bridge between Two Gallants and Stephens' solo work, these songs contain an introspection and musical diversity that has not been touched on before. Produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli, We Live on Cliffs features Stephens on vocals, guitar and piano and a host of guest musicians including Patrick Hallahan and Bo Koster (My Morning Jacket), Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Joey Waronker, Cody Votolato (Blood Brothers / Jaguar Love), Mike Daly, Petra Haden, Andy Cabic (Vetiver) and current band members Jen Grady, Matt Montgomery and Omar Cuellar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5f4aab0935a36697b5649225d3c085deb92f00d","amp;dn":"Adam+Haworth+Stephens+-+We+Live+On+Cliffs+%5B2010%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5f4aab0935a36697b5649225d3c085deb92f00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,244,170,176,147,90,54,105,123,86,73,34,93,60,8,93,235,146,240,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
