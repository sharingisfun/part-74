Image editing of the next generation goes further and addresses directly the weak points of digital photographs, to which even the most expensive cameras are not immune. Photomizer knows all the hurdles that need to be cleared in order to produce perfect photos; and it provides the suitable tools to obtain them. For beautiful photo albums and complete success at Flickr &amp; Co.\n\nPhotomizer is the perfect completion to your digital camera, be it expensive or low-priced.\n\nBecause a wrong aperture is easily selected and there is hardly any cure for adverse weather conditions and unfavourable lighting conditions. With Photomizer you re-adjust tonality, increase the contrast, re-sharpen matt images and you get high-definition and colour-intensive photos - fully automatic! Photomizer turns wasted pictures, which otherwise would be irretrievably lost, into natural and attractive photos without giving the impression of artificial editing.\n\nWith Photomizer you achieve results, which even professional photographers could only obtain with extensive knowledge and experience...\n\nWhile other editing programs require extensive training and time-consuming settings, Photomizer starts directly. Fully automatic and with the right sense for correct screws and settings! Photomizer accurately uses a number of photographic tools for optimum image manipulation; these tools automated and precisely edit exactly those unfavourable image attributes that disturb the overall impression!
