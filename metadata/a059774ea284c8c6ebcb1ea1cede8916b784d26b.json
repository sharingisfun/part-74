Behind their mysterious disappearance lies a legend of power and destruction that will ultimately determine the future of humanity. As Gage Blackwood, Agent #5 of the Temporal Security Agency, you will travel through time, assume multiple identities, and weave your way through an intricate web of puzzles. Hidden within these lost worlds lies the key to mankind's survival.\n\nJourneyman Project 3 is a worthy installment of the franchise. A fascinating story, memorable characters, and puzzles that are both fun and intuitive are only the tip of an iceberg of what this game has to offer. The third installment features gameplay improvements like a first person perspective view, and the new &quot;Chameleon Jumpsuit&quot; that lets you interact with characters form the past. Also, Jerry Rector does an excellent job playing Gage Blackwood. When compared to the previous installments, this one is everything they were and more. If you are a fan of the series than this is a no-brainer. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard of those games before then this is a good place to start, even though this is the third part, because the story exists independently from the previous ones, and the production values and gameplay are top of their class.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\nMoto Racer 1, 2\nLegends of Grimrock\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a059774ea284c8c6ebcb1ea1cede8916b784d26b","amp;dn":"Journeyman+Project+3+-+Legacy+of+Time+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a059774ea284c8c6ebcb1ea1cede8916b784d26b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,89,119,78,162,132,200,198,235,203,30,161,206,222,137,22,183,132,210,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
