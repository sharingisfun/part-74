However, what you'll notice immediately are the wonderfully delightful illustrations of the little monkey's journey to a faraway land. It makes you want to, quite literally, dive right in.\n\nRead this book to your kids before their next doctor's visit or to yourself before a big presentation. The 5-year-old in you will be glad you did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841b2b9164fe49381a619211313df5832d1c54b2","amp;dn":"The+Brave+Monkey+Pirate+%7Eariane_c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841b2b9164fe49381a619211313df5832d1c54b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,27,43,145,100,254,73,56,26,97,146,17,49,61,245,131,45,28,84,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
