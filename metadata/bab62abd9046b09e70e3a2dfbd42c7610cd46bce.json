We learn a few masking and painting techniques to fill in the gaps for some of the areas that are covered up in the photos. Then, we dive into After Effects and start building our scene by laying the ground, sky, and tree layers.\n\nAfter we've added and built the assets we need, we start to layer on the atmosphere effects. We create dust and fog particle systems using Trapcode's Particular plug-in. We also add a few lens effects to make the whole shot feel more realistic.\n\nWe finish off the tutorial with two lessons on sound design to make your entire video a truly immersive experience. This training is perfect for the intermediate After Effects user who wants to learn how to create a motion design project using realistic looking assets and sound to bring it to life. By the end of this training, you'll have created your own scary forest scene complete with a seamless camera transition from one composition to the next. You'll have also learned some of the basics for creating a project that uses sound in After Effects.\n\nLessons:\n1. Introduction and project overview\n2. Isolating the ground in Photoshop\n3. Placing the trees on their own layers and erasing the backgrounds\n4. Masking the area around the figures and placing them on individual layers\n5.

Placing the ground layers and sky\n9. Adding a Camera and Null Object\n10. Positioning the trees in Z-Space\n11. Placing the people and setting keyframes for their movements\n12. Animating the man's face using Liquify\n13. Refining the Camera movement\n14. Adding a lens flare to mimic a light source\n15. Using the bird video\n16. Creating dust particles with Particular\n17. Making dynamic fog using an image and Particular\n18. Changing the mood of the scene with an adjustment layer and adding a vignette\n19. Creating a new composition for the cards\n20. Setting up two lights for the card composition\n21. Placing the cards in the scene\n22. Animating the card's positions\n23. Refining the card animation\n24.
