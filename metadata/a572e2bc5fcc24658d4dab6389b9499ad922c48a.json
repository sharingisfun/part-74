Its invention and introduction into British service were in direct response to the success of the Prussian Dreyse needle gun, which demonstrated that the breech-loading rifle offered faster loading, improved accuracy and superior range; significantly, the weapon could be loaded and fired from a prone position, thus offering the rifleman greater security on the battlefield. Due to the longevity of service, many Martini-Henry rifles survive today, both in museums and in private collections, and the weapon is highly prized by shooting enthusiasts. Featuring specially commissioned full-colour artwork and an array of arresting first-hand accounts and written by an authority on warfare in the Victorian era, this engaging study tells the story of the powerful Martini-Henry and its impact on the battlefield, from the Anglo-Zulu War to the opening months of World War I.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Martini-Henry-Rifle-Weapon-Stephen-Manning/dp/1780965060&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Martini-Henry-Rifle-Weapon-Stephen-Manning/dp/1780965060&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a572e2bc5fcc24658d4dab6389b9499ad922c48a","amp;dn":"The+Martini-Henry+Rifle+%28Osprey+Weapon+26%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a572e2bc5fcc24658d4dab6389b9499ad922c48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,114,226,188,95,204,36,101,141,77,171,99,137,185,73,154,217,34,196,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
