He guarded the Fair and fought those criminals and racketeers who threatened it.\n\nHe later became known as &quot;Fantoman.&quot; The Fantom was strong enough to bend gun barrels and also possessed great speed. He was also a skilled hypnotist and could tamper with people's memories.\nHe was also very hard-boiled and quite willing to torture enemies to get what he wanted, dedicating a room in his hideout for a collection of medival torture devices. His activities quickly spread beyond the World's Fair.\n\n\nSeed for all, Sharing is caring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d4ce0ca2c9d1bb26120cf256938e981b44e89e","amp;dn":"Fantom+of+the+Fair+Archive+Complete+1939+Centaur+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d4ce0ca2c9d1bb26120cf256938e981b44e89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,212,206,12,162,201,209,187,38,18,12,242,86,147,142,152,27,68,232,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
