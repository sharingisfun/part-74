It is a high-performance small-sized browser built for those who don't want the cumbersome slowness or size of Firefox or Chrome. Currently it looks best on a tablet, but it will be optimized for phone sized screens soon. I will try to update this as often as I have time (I am a student...). This is my most major app release to date and I'm proud of my work, so if you have ANY problems at all, PLEASE contact me. I always respond, as those that have contacted with me before know... and I'm nice :)\n\nNavigation:\n\nLong-press a tab to delete it\nLong-press the back button to exit the browser\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Mar 12, 2013)\n\n2.0.3 - bugfixes\nnew full-screen UI\ntweaked icon\nAnimations\nbetter rendering\nbetter performance in full-screen\nlower battery consumption\nChinese traditional language added\nChinese simplified language added\nFrench Language added\nfixed errors in settings\nfixed errors with bookmarks\nadded auto-complete when searching using browser history\nnow uses the standard android history\nUI tweaks\nNOTE: you cannot have bookmarks as your homescreen in fullscreen\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0166c8920775e4cbf0150d6aa7bd1f3c61f2befa","amp;dn":"Lightning+Browser+Pro+v2.0.0+APK+%28For+Android%29+-+G%E2%84%B0%E2%84%95IA%E2%84%92+V%26image%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0166c8920775e4cbf0150d6aa7bd1f3c61f2befa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,102,200,146,7,117,228,203,240,21,13,106,167,189,31,60,97,242,190,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
