Written by international experts, the text presents specifications for assessing water quality, technical issues associated with desalination technologies, and the chemical aspects of desalinated water and its microbiology.\n\nThe book also discusses environmental protection issues that assist in the optimization of proposed and existing desalination facilities to ensure that nations and consumers enjoy the benefits of the expanded access to desalinated water. This includes coverage of health and environmental issues such as energy conservation and sustainability as well as protection of delicate coastal ecosystems and groundwater from contamination by surface disposal of concentratesÃ¢â‚¬â€challenges that must be addressed during the design, construction, and operation of a desalination facility.\n\nDevelopment of new and improved desalinization technologies, including major cost reduction trends, have significantly broadened the opportunities to access large quantities of safe water in many parts of the world. And while there are many books available on desalination, this bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusual approach blends technical coverage of the latest technologies with coverage of the environmental and public health-related impacts of these technologies, setting it apart from other resources. It provides technical guidance based on the practical expertise of a balanced group of international scientists and engineers.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f60989cf8f9f86d7be1670d65c92649fd865444d","amp;dn":"Desalination+Technology%3A+Health+and+Environmental+Impacts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f60989cf8f9f86d7be1670d65c92649fd865444d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,9,137,207,143,159,134,215,190,22,112,214,92,146,100,159,216,101,68,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
