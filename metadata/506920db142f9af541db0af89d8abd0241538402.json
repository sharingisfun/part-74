I cut together all of the targaryen scenes from the first season into a single movie. \nI used iMovie to cut it all together into a 90 minute movie. I used avis from pirate bay, converted them to mov files, cut it up in iMovie and then converted it back to avi, so the quality is not great. I did this mostly just as an exercise in basic editing and to decide if I like iMovie (I don't, I'm going to use Final Cut for part 2). \nLook out for part 2, coming soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506920db142f9af541db0af89d8abd0241538402","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones%3B+Targaryen+Saga%2C+part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506920db142f9af541db0af89d8abd0241538402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,105,32,219,20,47,154,245,65,219,10,248,157,138,189,2,65,83,132,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
