Given a special mission by General George Washington, Carter was killed by British spies, and the information he was carrying fell into enemy hands. His spirit was confined to earth for his failure.\n\nBruce Carter III was the spitting image of his great-grandfather. He was visited by the ghost of Bruce Carter I, who showed him the location of a magical cloak and tri-corner hat that could give the wearer invulnerability and super strength. Only Carter III's girlfriend, Joan Farwell, knows of his dual identity. She figured it out during their first encounter (as she pointed out, she knew him too well to be fooled by a domino mask).\n\nIn addition to his superhuman strength and invulnerability, Fighting Yank was frequently aided by his grandfather's ghost, especially when he was in mortal danger. The ghost could manipulate the physical world and provide Bruce III with information and encouragement.\n\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685ddf801660547a13f1f968e06a8f6c0d4a46ff","amp;dn":"Fighting+Yank+Archive+Complete+1940%27s+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685ddf801660547a13f1f968e06a8f6c0d4a46ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,93,223,128,22,96,84,122,19,241,249,104,224,106,143,108,13,74,70,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
