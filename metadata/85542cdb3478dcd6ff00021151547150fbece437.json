Alex examines what the cover-up will look like and what stunt Obama will pull to divert attention away from the criminal activity and murderous complicity of the government. \n\nOn today's show, Alex talks about Benghazi, false flags and other relevant topics with Holland Vandennieuwenhof, the writer and producer for A Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995, a full-length documentary examining the Oklahoma City bombing.\n--\nI don't know why the show was described in this way. Holland was hosting the show throughout. Alex called in for about 17 minutes in the second hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
