Over a hundred diagrams and forty plates are combined with clear and detailed instructions for making patterns, so that the practical application of the methods is demonstrated side by side with the theory and basic principles. This book covers the basic course which for many years has been the foundation of all training at the Katinka School of Dress Designing and includes measurement and block patterns, circular patterns, simple pattern designing, yokes, dart manipulation, sleeves, collars and necklines, skirts, and the oneÃ¢â‚¬â€œpiece dress foundation. This edition also features a Fashion Supplement which offers directions illustrated with forty illuminating diagrams for the following subjects: shirt and jacket blocks for casual wear, shoulder pad allowances, cuff and sleeve openings, pockets, wrap and strap (or placket) openings, and halter necks.\n\nAbout the Author\nNatalie Bray trained in Paris while connected with a Court dressmaking business in London.
