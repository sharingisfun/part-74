Since his death in police custody, he has been called a martyr of the anti-apartheid movement.[4] While living, his writings and activism attempted to empower black people, and he was famous for his slogan &quot;black is beautiful&quot;, which he described as meaning: &quot;man, you are okay as you are, begin to look upon yourself as a human being&quot;.[5]\n\nDespite friction between the African National Congress and Biko throughout the 1970s[need quotation to verify] the ANC has included Biko in the pantheon of struggle heroes, going as far as using his image for campaign posters in South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0efbdb1d5d0a61fa43668218b5cf31ce997ae35","amp;dn":"Biko+-+Donald+Woods+%28Cry+Freedom%2C+Denzel+W.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0efbdb1d5d0a61fa43668218b5cf31ce997ae35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,239,189,177,213,208,166,31,164,54,104,33,139,92,243,28,233,151,174,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
