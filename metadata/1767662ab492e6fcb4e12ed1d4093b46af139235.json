Now she must take on a nightmarish new challenge. Someone is stealing the children of the fae as well as mortal children, and all signs point to Blind Michael. Toby has no choice but to track the villain down-even when there are only three magical roads by which to reach Blind Michael's realm, home of the Wild Hunt-and no road may be taken more than once. If Toby cannot escape with the children, she will fall prey to the Wild Hunt and Blind Michael's inescapable power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1767662ab492e6fcb4e12ed1d4093b46af139235","amp;dn":"An+Artificial+Night+by+Seanan+McGuire%2C+October+Daye%2C+Book+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1767662ab492e6fcb4e12ed1d4093b46af139235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,103,102,42,180,146,230,252,180,225,46,209,212,9,59,70,175,19,146,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
