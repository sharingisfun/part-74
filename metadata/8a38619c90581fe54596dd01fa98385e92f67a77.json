He is (reluctantly) helped in his charade by his best friend, Burton &quot;Gus&quot; Guster (DulÃƒÂ© Hill), and his father, Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen). He generally works with police detectives Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) and Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and under the direction of Police Chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).
