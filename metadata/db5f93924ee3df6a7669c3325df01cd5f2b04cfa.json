THIS UPLOAD WAS PREPARED ON 04.11.13, THIS DAY 14 OF MY 'ECOCIDE'S DEATH FAST, ZERO CALORIES,' RACING TO FINISH THIS PROJECT SO I CAN ABSTAIN FROM LIQUIDS AS WELL BY MIDNIGHHT SUNDAY NIGHT. GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.

This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!
