The band was led by James' sometime producer Dave Matthews, and this is their one-off LP of killer fuzzed-out funk (emphasis on) rock. &quot;The Grodeck Whipperjenny, recorded in 1970 in Cincinnati, is an album that won universal critical claim but still failed to propel the highly talented outfit into the big time. Described by one critic as 'a superb psychedelic/progressive effort -- full of imagination and fresh ideas,' others locked into the album's abundant funky rhythms, prompting another pundit to excitedly proclaim Grodeck as 'an acid funk monster of an album which will blow the flavor saver right off your mug!' Every track is excellent in its own right which makes it difficult to single out particular highlights, but 'Conclusions' is a superb instrumental of jaw-dropping strings, heavy Hammond and stinging guitar, while 'Evidence For The Existence Of The Unconscious' features fine keyboards, echoed vocal and fuzz guitar.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dd39b5df90a2398aacdd36992a2da513b935f66","amp;dn":"The+Grodeck+Whipperjenny+%281970%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dd39b5df90a2398aacdd36992a2da513b935f66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,211,155,93,249,10,35,152,170,205,211,105,146,162,218,81,59,147,95,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
