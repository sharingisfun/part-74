Fixed XZ archive support, which did not work in beta 2.\n\n   2. &quot;Convert&quot; command did not allow to use compression dictionaries\n      exceeding 4 MB.\n\n   3. If both encryption password and archive comment were specified\n      when creating RAR archive, archive comment was not added.\n\n   4. &quot;View as Unicode (UTF-8)&quot; command in internal viewer did not work,\n      so UTF-8 files were displayed correctly only if their encoding\n      was detected by viewer automatically.\n\n   5. Maximum compression dictionary size when running in Windows XP x86\n      is reduced to 128 MB. WinRAR cannot allocate enough memory to\n      create archives with 256 MB dictionary in Windows XP x86.\n\n   6. Corrections in relative path processing, such as &quot;..arcname.rar&quot; name\n      in archiving dialog or &quot;WinRAR foldername&quot; in the command line.\n\n\n\nWinrar 5.00 Beta 3 Activated Multi Edition\n\nOnly Single Setup Which include 64 and 32 files.\n\nInstall 64 bit files on 64 bit operating system\n\nInstall 32 bit files on 32 bit operating system\n\n\nReg Key Already Inserted\n\n\nNow Why You save two different setups for 32 bit and 64 bit\n\n\nNow use this setup which can work for 32 and 64 bit systems\n\n\nAlso update version mode\n\n\nwith update version checked option it will be a portable winrar no uninstall file \n\nwill created in control panel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb1303b1769343bc990809cc0ad4217dc177d19","amp;dn":"Winrar+5.00+Beta+3+Activated+Multi+Edition%5BA4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb1303b1769343bc990809cc0ad4217dc177d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,177,48,59,23,105,52,59,201,144,128,156,192,173,66,23,220,23,125,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
