For the CD available exclusively with this book, Langford returned to those lost recordings and radically revised them, enlisting as his accomplices the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus, who contribute a unique warmth to the material.&quot;\nJon Langford revived one of his earliest (and best) albums, now with additional songs and featuring the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus. This is unbelievably wonderful - and included with a 100-page hardcover book by Langford for only $20.\nMekons ringleader Jon Langford delivers an infectious set of heartfelt rock on his first-ever solo album (not counting 1995's one-shot Johnny Cash album, released as Jonnyboy); more straight-ahead than the current Mekons and largely eschewing the country twang of honky-tonkin' side band the Waco Brothers, Langford enlists backing from members of both groups (like Mekons drummer Steve Goulding) to forge his own, surprisingly accessible, solo sound. In fact, the disc is the most listener-friendly thing that Langford's done since 1993's &quot;I Kiss Your Wicked Midnite&quot; from I (heart) Mekons. Were it not for Skull Orchard's small label pedigree and the singer-guitarist's burrlike voice--a little too abrasive for drive time--revved-up rockers like &quot;Trapdoor&quot; and &quot;I Am the Law&quot; could be hit-bound. Lyrical allusions to Langford's hometown of Wales abound (and the cover sleeve, designed by the singer, features levitating Welshman Tom Jones), and in case you forgot that this is the cofounder of the highfalutin Mekons we're talking about, you also get a Gertrude Stein poem set to rock (&quot;Butter Song&quot;) and a couple of gorgeous and enigmatic ballads as well as a larkish, drink-soaked coda. --Don Harrison","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27af82b8967eeb57a594898e5fb57de470116af0","amp;dn":"Jon+Langford+-+Skull+Orchard+Revisited+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27af82b8967eeb57a594898e5fb57de470116af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,175,130,184,150,126,235,87,165,148,137,142,95,181,125,228,112,17,106,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
