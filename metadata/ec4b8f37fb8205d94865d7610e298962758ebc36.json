Now Rocky's a bit strange but loves Michael and only has his best interest. Michael would live with Rocky after his parents died. Michael would grow up go to school, become a doctor, Rocky would live alone abut when Rocky's about to be thrown out and placed in a retirement home, he refuses. Michael then takes him in. They would stay together even when Michael got married and had a family. And Rocky would always be there for Michael and Michael for him. *** Falk stars as Rocky Holzcek, a cantankerous 76-year-old Polish-American baker who insists, despite relatives' protests, upon adopting his young grandson Michael when the boy's parents pass away. Twenty years later, Michael (D.B. Sweeney) is a medical student who's forced to take in his still-spry grandfather when the old man is evicted from his apartment building. Although the crusty, outspoken Rocky gets along fine with Michael's Chinese college roommates, he is less enthused about his grandson's girlfriend Beth (Julianne Moore). Eventually, Michael and Beth marry, move away and\nhave children, while Rocky continues working as a baker, passing the age of 100. When a tragedy befalls Michael and his kids, the old man once again comes to his grandson's rescue, but even a force of nature like Rocky can't last forever. Roommates was loosely based on the real-life experiences of screenwriter Max Apple and his grandfather. \n\n\nGeneral\n---------\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 900 MiB\nDuration : 1h 49mn\nOverall bit rate : 1154 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2550\n\n\nVideo\n-----------\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 49mn\nBit rate : 1019 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.189\nStream size : 795 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 64\n\n\nAudio\n--------\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 99.7 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 83 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration : 504 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.99r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4b8f37fb8205d94865d7610e298962758ebc36","amp;dn":"Roommates+1995+DVDRip+XviD+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4b8f37fb8205d94865d7610e298962758ebc36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,75,143,55,251,130,5,217,72,101,215,97,14,41,137,98,117,142,188,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
