Although hailing from Stockholm, Sweden they only released a single in Finland, which has since become one of the most sought after pieces of vinyl from the era. \n\nBaby Grandmothers were formed out of the legendary R&amp;B / beat band T-Boones in the summer of 1967. T-Boones are probably best known for their Ã¢â‚¬Å“At the club/King of the OrientÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ single which is one of the best, and most collectable, out of the Swedish garage beat-era. Guitar-wiz Kenny HÃƒÂ¥kansson joined the band in 1965 and with the group down to a trio they drifted into the psychedelic sounds of the time and in August 1967 released the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which definitely was the first hard-rock recording ever made in Sweden. \n\nThe band was then re-christened Baby Grandmothers by the co-founder of the newly opened psychedelic club Filips, for which he needed a house-band. Filips was the legendary breeding ground for bands such as Hansson &amp; Karlsson, PÃƒÂ¤rson Sound, as well as orgiastic all night jams with foreign luminaries such as Jimi Hendrix and the Mothers of Invention. \n\nBaby Grandmothers also supported Jimi Henrix on his Swedish tour in 1968 and then turned into Mecki Mark Men, who became the first Swedish rock band to tour the US. Founding member Kenny HÃƒÂ¥kansson went on to form the highly influential Kebnekajse, who created the Swedish electric folk psych sound. \n\nThis unique collection brings live-recordings made at Filips, their impossibly rare single and a rare live recording made in Finland.
