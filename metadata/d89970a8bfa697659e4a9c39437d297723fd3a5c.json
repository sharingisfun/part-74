France has been captivated by the idea that he's a rakish Anglo troubadour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic guitar, jaunty hat, weatherbeaten voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with a streak of Gallic seen-it-allness (as made manifest by the line &quot;I sit around drinking coffee all day/ Nothing to do and a little to say&quot; in Speak to Me). The romance of it all doesn't play quite so well in Britain, but this album is still a palatable addition to the adult-contemporary genre. While his default style is the wronged-Romeo acoustic melancholia of Hello Alone, he's comfortable and convincing in other styles: Princely electro-funk (Until You're Satisfied), beatboxing (Speak to Me) and Paul Youngish white soul (Where Can I Buy Happiness?). All that's keeping him from UK success is the surfeit of similar songwriters, from Chris Rea to his own better-established brother, Tom Baxter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89970a8bfa697659e4a9c39437d297723fd3a5c","amp;dn":"Charlie+Winston+-+Running+Still+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89970a8bfa697659e4a9c39437d297723fd3a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,153,112,168,191,166,151,101,158,74,156,57,67,125,41,119,35,253,58,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
