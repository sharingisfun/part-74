The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round on most servers. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.\n\nShooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. Shot damage depends upon where the bullet hits, with hits to the head often being lethal.\n[hide]System requirements\n\tMinimum \tRecommended\nMicrosoft Windows\nOperating system \tWindows 7 (32/64-bit)/Vista/XP\nCPU \t1.7 GHz processor \tPentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better)\nMemory \t512 MB \t1 GB\nGraphics hardware \tDirectX 8.1 level graphics card (requires support for SSE) \tDirectX 9 level graphics card\nNetwork \tInternet connection required\nMac OS X\nOperating system \tOS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3\nMemory \t1 GB\nGraphics hardware \tNVIDIA GeForce 8 or higher, ATI X1600 or higher, or Intel HD 3000\nNetwork \tInternet connection required\nLinux\nOperating system \tUbuntu 12.04 32/64bit\nCPU \t1.7 GHz processor\nMemory \t512 MB\nNetwork \tInternet connection required\nHistory\n\nCounter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber CafÃƒÂ© Program on August 11, 2004.[4][5] On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and those who had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards.[6] On October 11, 2006, Valve released an experimental update, Dynamic Weapons Pricing.
