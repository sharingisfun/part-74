Since losing a fortune in the 1987 stock market crash, which also cost him his marriage, David has led a Robinson Crusoe-like existence. Ben learns how to pick oysters, brew beer, trade fish and dance with the locals, finding out how it feels to truly live alone.\n\n2)  Alaska \nBen travels north to Alaska to live with Bretwood Higman, Erin McCittrick and their two children. Bretwood and Erin hiked 4,000 miles to get here, and the family now lives for half the year in a Mongolian-style yurt on the mountainside, with the other half spent hiking in the wilderness. While staying with them, Ben learns how to chop trees and protect himself from grizzly bears.\n\n3)  New Zealand \nBen travels to New Zealand, where he meets the Long family, who live as hunter-gatherers in the Gorge River area of National Park. He helps dad Robert to hunt for rock lobsters and catch eels, while mum Catherine must climb a sheer waterfall to check for storm damage to the family's gravity-fed water pipe.\n\n4)  Texas \nTerlingua, a crumbling ghost town a couple of miles from the Mexican border in Texas, is the last staging post for Ben on his way to meet John Wells, an ex-fashion photographer from New York who has turned his back on the bright lights of the big city to experience a desolate desert dream.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3470/newlivesinthewildscreenl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3470/newlivesinthewildscreenl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5500/newlivesinthewildscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n2)  PDTV \n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1897 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: average 650 MB\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2a54b93f705fbf1a4aeffbe73b75d5f8d48ea5","amp;dn":"Ch5+New+Lives+in+the+Wild+2of4+Alaska+PDTV+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2a54b93f705fbf1a4aeffbe73b75d5f8d48ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,42,84,185,63,112,95,191,26,74,239,251,231,59,117,213,248,212,142,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
