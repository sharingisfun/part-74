He served as the 265th pope from 2005 to 2013. In that role he was both the leader of the Catholic Church and Sovereign of the Vatican City State. Benedict was elected on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave, celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24 April 2005, and took possession of his cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, on 7 May 2005.\n\nOn 11 February 2013, Pope Benedict announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals, citing a &quot;lack of strength of mind and body&quot; due to his advanced age. His resignation became effective on 28 February 2013. He is the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, and the first to do so on his own initiative since Pope Celestine V in 1294. As pope emeritus, Benedict retains the style of His Holiness, and the title of Pope, and will continue to dress in the papal colour of white. He is expected to move into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae monastery for his retirement.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5904ed630a0a4ba4e333e7833c49c1702722b9a3","amp;dn":"Clifford+W.+Mills+-+Pope+Benedict+XVI+%28Modern+World+Leaders%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5904ed630a0a4ba4e333e7833c49c1702722b9a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,4,237,99,10,10,75,164,227,51,231,131,60,73,193,112,39,34,185,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
