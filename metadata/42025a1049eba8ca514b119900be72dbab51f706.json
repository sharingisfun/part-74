This CD reissue finds the group playing fairly basic material, including a pair of McDuff originals, &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot; and &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot; McDuff, Forrest, and Winchester have no difficulty chewing up the chord changes, and although no real surprises occur, the results are typically swingin' and groovin'. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Smooth Sailing\n02. Mean to Me\n03. Tippin' In\n04. Yeah, Baby\n05. Autumn Leaves\n06. Tough 'Duff\n\nEnjoy and share!
