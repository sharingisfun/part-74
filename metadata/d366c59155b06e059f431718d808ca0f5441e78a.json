The alternate take of &quot;There Is No Greater Love&quot; from the latter date has also been added as a bonus track. Unfortunately, due to a lack of disc space, the session's other two alternate takes were not included here.\n&quot;My facility on the instrument is natural to a certain extent, but you have to develop it. You can't just say that a guy's a natural, and he gets up and just starts playing all the stuff. It's just from playing constantly. Every opportunity that I ever had in my life to play jazz, I would play... To be perfectly honest, I was never conscious of developing a particular style; it just turned out that that was my way of playing. Not that I haven't listened to other players - you have to, to learn anything about it in the first place. I leave myself open to listen to all players; even when I was younger, I just didn't listen to trombone players, period. For one thing, I've always thought in terms of playing like a tenor player - more so than like other trombonists.&quot; (Frank Rosolino)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Cherry\n02 - Let's make It\n03 - How Long Has This Been Going On\n04 - They Say\n05 - Fine Shape\n06 - Fallout\n07 - Thou Swell\n08 - Tuffy\n09 - Love For Sale\n10 - Twilight\n11 - Don't Take Your Love From Me\n12 - Chrisdee\n13 - Stardust\n14 - Free For All\n15 - There Is No Greater Love\n16 - Sneakyoso\n17 - There Is No Greater Love (alt.)\n\nPersonnel:\nFRANK ROSOLINO plays trombone on all tracks, accompanied by:\n1-8: RICHIE KAMUCA (ts), VINCE GUARALDI (p), MONTY BUDWIG (b), STAN LEVEY (d).
