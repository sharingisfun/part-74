This ripe, colorful adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's vicious novel The Talented Mr. Ripley, directed by the versatile RenÃƒÂ© ClÃƒÂ©ment, stars Delon as Tom Ripley, a duplicitous American charmer in Rome on a mission to bring his privileged, devil-may-care acquaintance Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) back to the United States. What initially seems a carefree tale of friendship soon morphs into a thrilling saga of seduction, identity theft, and murder. Featuring gorgeous on-location photography in coastal Italy, Purple Noon is crafted with a light touch that allows it to be suspenseful and erotic at once, while giving Delon the role of a lifetime.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nInterview With Rene Clement Scholar And Author Denitza Bantcheva\nArchival Interviews With Actor Alain Delon And Novelist Patricia Highsmith, On Whose Book The Talented Mr. Ripley The Film Is Based\nOriginal English Language Trailer\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
