It was first published by William Heinemann in London in October 1902. The individual chapters had originally been published in 1890-96 as a series of essays in the British monthly literary magazine, Nineteenth Century.\n\nWritten partly in response to Social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, &quot;The Struggle for Existence&quot;, Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that cooperation and mutual aid are the most important factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPrince Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin (Russian: ???? ??????Ã‚Â´???? ?????Ã‚Â´????; 9 December 1842 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8 February 1921) was a Russian zoologist, evolutionary theorist, philosopher, scientist, revolutionary, philologist, economist, activist, geographer, writer and prominent anarcho-communist.\n\nKropotkin advocated a communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations between workers. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, and his principal scientific offering, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. He also contributed the article on anarchism to the EncyclopÃƒÂ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition.[1]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de8118dc73f20ce82d779013821ebc3eca1c7c41","amp;dn":"Mutual+Aid%2C+A+Factor+of+Evolution+-+Peter+Kropotkin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de8118dc73f20ce82d779013821ebc3eca1c7c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,129,24,220,115,242,12,232,45,119,144,19,130,30,188,62,202,28,124,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
