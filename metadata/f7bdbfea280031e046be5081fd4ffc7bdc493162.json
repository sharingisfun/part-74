Trilogy: The Wonder, Hyperstation, Eliminator Jr.\n\nAudrius DaukÃ…Â¡a cameraman\n___________________________\n\n\n20130320 thewaymouth aka mikedreams on... And now it's Springtime for Scheise!\n\n- Further video notes... * Fade Outs @ conclusion of songs\n\n* Flaws: Very occasional &amp; very brief, A/V glitches \n(everything stops &amp; goes green for just a sec),\n[They are found as well in the online videos]\nlike here (and I think that's all of them - 10 - all listed in accompanying text]\n@ 07:56, near start of Kissability\n\n- Cameraman has an unobstructed view and a steady hand, and appears to be shooting from the center balcony.\n\n- Caps n Banner c/o Capt. Captastic incl. (total of 28 jpegs @ 4.5mb)\n\n- md: A/V : 8.5/8.5\n\n- &quot;But, this is just a bag of shit!&quot; - &quot;Yes, but it's really great shit, Mrs. Prezky!&quot; The decadence of the west is the best so open the door and let em in already.\n\nDespite the damn bitches that are the glitches (especially the frequency on Hyperstation), the file is a document of an amazing time, not to be missed. The show itself is without a shadow of a doubt the shit.\n\nNot to be outdone by the boys, the mighty Kim makes with the drumstick to her bass during The Wonder. All the while she is kickin her candy Andy Warhol/Marylin Monroe hose; you know those from the Kool Thing video. Thurston even dedicates Silver Rocket to the American pop-art icon. Only with a plastic exploding inevitable performance for the ages. Looks like we're not in Vilnius anymore. The band is smoking on some heavy, iron curtain rolling papers now. Out in Eric's Trip, Lee yells &quot;Dig it! Dig it! Dig it, dig it!&quot; And so Lithuanian youth shake and hop while the band sings all night about fucking the future. Kim then sends out to all of Lithuania, 'The Sprawl.' Anybody who wasn't already, is all in. Even a momentary, onstage power-outage at the start of 'Cross The Breeze, only leads to a rededication to the festive manifesto of the Teenage Riots of 1989. &quot;It's time to get it/ Before you let it/ Get to you.&quot; And getting after it thereafter is just like before, like all get-out.\n\n- &quot;Alright, pretty fuckin avant fuckin garde! [Take it] from the rock. From the rock...&quot;\n- &quot;From right where it goes into it.&quot;\n______________________________________\n\n- Full sample(s):\n\nCaps: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture51.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture51.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture60.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture60.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture61.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture61.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture62.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture62.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture69.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture69.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture68.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture68.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture97.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture97.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture96.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture96.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture71.jpg:original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Sonic%20Youth/NewPicture71.jpg:original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7bdbfea280031e046be5081fd4ffc7bdc493162","amp;dn":"Sonic+Youth+-+Live+in+Vilnius+1989+%282012%29+%5BHT+-+MP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7bdbfea280031e046be5081fd4ffc7bdc493162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,189,191,234,40,0,49,224,70,190,80,129,253,79,252,123,220,73,49,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
