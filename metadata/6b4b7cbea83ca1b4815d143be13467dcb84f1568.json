Wakelyn et al., Ã‚Â«Cotton Fiber Chemistry and TechnologyÃ‚Â»\nCRC | ISBN 1420045873 | 2006-12-15 | 162 pages | PDF | 10.7 Mb \n\nAnnual cotton production exceeds 25 million metric tons and accounts for more than 40 percent of the textile fiber consumed worldwide. A key textile fiber for over 5000 years, this complex carbohydrate is also one of the leading crops to benefit from genetic engineering. Cotton Fiber Chemistry and Technology offers a modern examination of cotton chemistry and physics, classification, production, and applications. The book incorporates new insight, technological developments, and other considerations.\n\nThe book focuses on providing the most up-to-date information on cotton fiber chemistry and properties. Written by leading authorities in cotton chemistry and science, the book details fiber biosynthesis, structure, chemical composition and reactions, physical properties and includes information on biotech, organic, and colored cotton. The final chapters examine worldwide production, consumption, markets, and trends in the cotton industry. They also address environmental, workplace, and consumer risks from exposure to processing chemicals and emissions.
