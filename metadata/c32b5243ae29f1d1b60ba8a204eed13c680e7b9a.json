His book, The Three Pillars of Zen, was published in 1965, has been translated into 12 languages, and is still in print. It was one of the first English-language books to present Zen Buddhism not as philosophy, but as a pragmatic and salutary way of training and living.\n\nKapleau was an articulate and passionate writer. His emphasis in writing and teaching was that insight and enlightenment are available to anyone, not just austere and isolated Zen monks. Also well known for his views on vegetarianism, peace and compassion, he remains widely read, and is a notable influence on Zen Buddhism as it is practiced in the West. Today, his dharma heirs, descendants and former students teach at Zen Centers around the world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32b5243ae29f1d1b60ba8a204eed13c680e7b9a","amp;dn":"Philip+Kapleau+-+The+Three+Pillars+of+Zen+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32b5243ae29f1d1b60ba8a204eed13c680e7b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,43,82,67,174,41,241,209,182,11,168,162,4,238,209,60,104,14,123,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
