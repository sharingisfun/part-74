It was released as a 7&quot; single in December 1981 in the United States and in January 1982 in the UK, on Liberty. It was the second single released from the band's sixth album &quot;La Folie&quot;. In 2012 it was judged the UK's fifth-favourite single to have missed the Number 1 slot. There has been much controversy surrounding the lyrics. In his 2001 book The Stranglers Song By Song, Hugh Cornwell clearly states &quot;'Golden Brown' works on two levels. It's about heroin and also about a girl&quot;. Essentially the lyrics describe how &quot;both provided me with pleasurable times&quot;.\n     The video for &quot;Golden Brown&quot;, directed by Lindsey Clennell, depicts the band members both as explorers in an Arabian country (sequences include images of the Pyramids as well as the explorers studying a map of Egypt) in the 1920s and performers for a fictional &quot;Radio Cairo&quot;. In addition to the Pyramids, the video is intercut with stock footage of a madrassa in Uzbekistan, the Shah Mosque in Isfahan, Iran and Great Sphinx, Feluccas sailing, Bedouins riding and camel racing in the United Arab Emirates. The performance scenes were filmed in the Leighton House Museum in Holland Park, London.\nGenre :  New Wave, Baroque pop\n\n    &quot;European Female&quot; is a single by  The Stranglers, released in 1982. It is taken from the album &quot;Feline&quot; where it features under its full title &quot;The European Female (In Celebration Of)&quot;. The track features bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel on lead vocals.  It reached number nine in the UK singles charts where it spent six weeks.\nGenre : New Wave \n\n\n    &quot;Skin Deep&quot;ia a song by The Stranglers, from their eighth album &quot;Aural Sculpture&quot; Album  reached number 14 in the U.K. album charts in November 1984. There were three singles released from the album: &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (#15 in the UK singles chart), &quot;No Mercy&quot; (#37 in the UK singles chart) and &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; (#48 in the UK singles chart). \nGenre :  New Wave, Post-punk, Punk rock \n\n    &quot;Always the Sun&quot; is a song by The Stranglers, first released as a single in October 1986, the second single from the album Dreamtime. A remixed version was released as a single in December 1990. Despite radio play and much hype, it only reached number 30 in the UK singles chart. However, it was a hit throughout Europe (#15 in France, #16 in Ireland) and nearly broke the Stranglers in America due to radio play. The song also reached #21 in Australia.\nGenre : New Wave \n\n    &quot;96 Tears&quot; is a popular song recorded by Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians  in 1966.
