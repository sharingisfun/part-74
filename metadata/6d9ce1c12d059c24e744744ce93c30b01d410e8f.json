It was a truly pioneering programme that brought the hidden wonders of the world's oceans into their living rooms for the first time.\n\nA pioneer of marine biology as well as the technology involved in underwater exploration, Jacques Cousteau's work is a colourful, revealing window onto a world that few of us will ever see first-hand. This comprehensive 36-episode series follows the crew as they study life in every corner of the globe: from sharks in the Red Sea to penguins in Antarctica, from coral reefs to hippos, octopus to sea otters. Taking time to study the intimate behavior of a wide spectrum of animals in their natural environment, each new variety of marine life they encounter is approached with the same passion, deep interest and respect. A tough mission it may be, but whether they are swimming with whales or diving for sunken treasure, life on board Calypso is never dull.\n\n\nThe creators of the first underwater nature documentaries ever filmed, Cousteau and his crew wrote the rules as they went along. If they saw a creature struggling or suffering in the wild, they would be just as likely to intervene and lend a hand as to document the harsh realities of the natural world. Profoundly respectful of nature but never sentimental, the crew of Calypso and their amazing adventures reveal almost as much about the depths of human compassion as they do the depths of our verdant oceans.\n\nThis landmark natural history title can now be viewed in its entirety, after the 2011 DVD release. \n\nDirected by Philippe Cousteau &amp; Jack Watson\nProduced by Philippe Cousteau &amp; Jack Kaufman \nExecutive Producers : Jacques- Yves Cousteau , Alan Landsburg and Marshall Flaum\nNarrated by Rod Serling, Joseph Campanella and Jacques- Yves Cousteau\nSeries Cinematography by Michel Deloire , Philippe Cousteau and Yves Omer\n\n1991 The Cousteau Croup, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n13)  The Coral Divers of Corsica \nThe Calypso travels to the Mediterranean to study the forests of red coral off the coast of Corsica, harvested by divers who must descend to extremely dangerous depths.
