The songs on HC's debut album revolve around communal living, gay love, and religious imagery. Singer/guitarist Joel Gibb's 15-member band (some of whom don little more than balaclavas when playing live) overcome possible charges that they're a novelty act thanks to GibbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack of creating expansive, uplifting songs layered with flute, harp, trombone, and sleigh bells. &quot;Day is Dawning&quot; begins as a gently strummed paean to creation and slowly builds into a lilting, choral-tinged thing of loveliness. &quot;Boys of Melody&quot; is similarly beguiling, as Gibb gazes &quot;far out at sea bathed in breeze&quot; over the most simple, affecting melody this side of Mercury Rev. --Suzannah Brown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe61c2e822e0672981171f9addcd57ae6adc0be","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Cameras+-+The+Smell+Of+Our+Own+%5B2003%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe61c2e822e0672981171f9addcd57ae6adc0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,230,28,46,130,46,6,114,152,17,113,249,173,220,213,122,230,173,192,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
