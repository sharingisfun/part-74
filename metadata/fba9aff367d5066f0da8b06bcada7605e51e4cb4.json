Hungerford, Douglas J. Shaw \n\n\nOfficial description:\n\n\nRespected for its detailed guidance in using technology, CONTEMPORARY PRECALCULUS: A GRAPHING APPROACH, Fifth Edition, is written from the ground up to be used with graphing calculators that you may be using in your precalculus course. You'll appreciate that the text has also long been recognized for its careful, thorough explanations and its presentation of mathematics in an informal yet mathematically precise manner. The authors also emphasize the all-important &quot;why?&quot; of mathematics--which is addressed in both the exposition and in the exercise sets by focusing on algebraic, graphical, and numerical perspectives.\n\n\nHope this helps someone who may be too poor/cheap to afford the text book.
