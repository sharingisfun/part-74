The other, not so good.\n\nThe album kick starts with Ã¢â‚¬Å“What You Wanna Do,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Original SinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Skinny Bones Jones.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Three uninspired songs that just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t grab your attention at all, then Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bag of TricksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hits your ear drums and all that negativity is out the window. The thought of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthis bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely got itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comes to your mind. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a real Traveling WilburysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (the legendary band featuring Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and George Harrison) sound to it that makes you say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“awesome.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe awesomeness continues right after that with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fibber.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ One of my favorite tracks on the album (along with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here Goes NothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The lead singer hits some awesome notes and the writing is well done.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Here Goes NothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is by far the best track on the album. They slow it down and hit you hard with some powerful vocals and spot on notes, all around perfect execution, which makes sense considering the album was produced by Niko Bolas. Bolas has also done Neil Young, Warren Zevon and Secret Sisters.\n\nWill I be following Infantree after this album? Your damn right. Sometimes its better to know that the best is yet to come. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be saying something different about Infantree Ã¢â‚¬Ëœafter the gold rushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:236385eab33114eeddad82d02893b3484538f9d5","amp;dn":"Infantree+-+Hero%27s+Dose+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"236385eab33114eeddad82d02893b3484538f9d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,99,133,234,179,49,20,238,221,173,130,208,40,147,179,72,69,56,249,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
