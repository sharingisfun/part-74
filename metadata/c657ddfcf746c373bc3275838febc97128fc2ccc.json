GAME.TYPE ........: Action\n\n\n Notes:\n  ~~~~~~\n  We pre'd within a minute of FLT because we were busy testing, a step they\n  obviously optimized away.\n\n  Anyway. FLT release is a mess; an installer that seems to freeze at the end\n  of installation, unnecessarily split into 2 DVDs while it could easily fit\n  on a single DVD9. More importantly, the Ranger Mode along with other Limited\n  Edition content is locked when using their crack. All data files in the two\n  releases are identical, so it is the crack.\n\n  It used to be that first complete and working release on sites won. Now it's\n  first to pre or last to proper/read.nfo. So here you have it.\n\n  --\n\n  It Is the Year 2034. \n\n  Beneath the ruins of post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of the Metro,\n  the remnants of mankind are besieged by deadly threats from outside  and\n  within. Mutants stalk the catacombs beneath the desolate surface, and hunt\n  amidst the poisoned skies above. \n\n  But rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are locked in a\n  struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults\n  of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the\n  earth forever. \n\n  As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key to our\n  survival  the last light in our darkest hour \n\n  Features\n  * A gripping, story-driven first person shooter, Metro: Last Light is the \n    hugely anticipated sequel to 2010's critically acclaimed cult classic \n    Metro 2033 \n  * Explore the post-apocalyptic world of the Moscow Metro, one of the most \n    immersive, atmospheric game worlds ever created \n\n\n\n  1.
