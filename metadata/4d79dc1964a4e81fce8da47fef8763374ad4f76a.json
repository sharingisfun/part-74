The show is clearly past its prime here, but CBS knew a good deal when they saw it: Peter Graves and company make a sensational on-screen team, and even if they're not working at full capacity, these episodes offer exceptionally entertaining escapist entertainment.\n\nThis collection sends the gang after a nuclear threat in a bizarre Asian country (Countdown), a neo-Nazi intent on overthrowing the American government (The Fuehrer's Children), and even a space-vessel mystery (Target Earth). Not surprisingly, these episodes are tailor-made for diehard superfans of Mission: Impossible's heyday (and few others), but if that theme music instinctively makes you want to sit on the couch and waste an hour in front of the boob tube, this box set is right up your alley.  \n\nEpisodes:  \n\n#1- &quot;The Golden Serpent (Part 1)&quot;  \nAfter the head of another IMF team is murdered, Jim and the rest set out to destroy an international drug triad. Greg Morris guest stars as Barney Collier.\n\n#2- &quot;The Golden Serpent (Part 2)&quot;\nConclusion.\n\n#3- &quot;The Princess&quot;\nA European princess is in danger of assassination.\n\n#4- &quot;Command Performance&quot;\nThe IMF must rescue a priest who can bring down a Baltic defense minister.  \n\n#5- &quot;Countdown&quot;  \nGrant must get close to a fanatical woman and find the location of a nuclear bomb.  \n\n#6- &quot;War Games&quot;\nA fanatical general plans to turn war games into the real thing.
