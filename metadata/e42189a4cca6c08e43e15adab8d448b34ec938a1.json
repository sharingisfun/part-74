Uploaded as Opera 12.15 defaults to Google search, basically it's been hard-coded and despite changing the options it always defaults back to Google.\n\nHopefully this will be updated in later versions of Opera, though maybe not as it almost seems to have been done accidentally on purpose, as strangely it is the only web browser left, other than Firefox that doesn't default to Google. Certainly last time I tested other Web Browsers this was the case. Maybe things have changed in the last 6 months or so.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42189a4cca6c08e43e15adab8d448b34ec938a1","amp;dn":"Opera+12.14+for+Intel+OS+X+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42189a4cca6c08e43e15adab8d448b34ec938a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,33,137,164,204,166,192,142,67,225,90,218,184,212,72,179,78,201,56,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
