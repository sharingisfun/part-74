The episodes were broadcast in other English-language regions, apparently, but no rips have surfaced thence to date. So, here's the French dub as a consolation offering, for the time being.\n\nThe good news: BAWLS is a bona-fide Scene group, and it shows. The quality of these episodes is just like what one is used to from domestic HDTV.x264-Scene releases.\n\nThe bad news: I trawled and scoured, yet could not find any English subs (any subs, period, in point of fact), so you'll either need at least a smattering of French, or will have to guess at what's happening based on the visuals alone.\n\nOf course, if someone else does manage to dig up those subs, or (okay, this is a stretch) wants to go to the trouble of writing them themselves and sharing with the rest of the class, please DO make good use of the comments section below to keep us informed. ;)\n\nAnyway... voila!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78960f93fec3434c33b6cb494abed1bd1559b23e","amp;dn":"Undercovers.S01E12-13.FRENCH.HDTV.x264-BAWLS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78960f93fec3434c33b6cb494abed1bd1559b23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,150,15,147,254,195,67,76,51,182,203,73,74,190,209,189,21,89,178,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
