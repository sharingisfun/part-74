Dinnerstein, 40, is a New Yorker, and a graduate of The Juilliard School. She was a winner of the Astral Artist National Auditions and has received the National Museum of Women in the Arts Award. Merritt, 38, is a self-taught guitarist and singer from Austin, Texas, who learned to play by ear, occasionally by listening to Percy Sledge.\nEven from the distance of a transatlantic phone call, you can sense how much they have relished the experience of working together. I wondered whether the process had made them face up to their own strengths Ã¢â‚¬â€ and weaknesses.\nMerritt says: &quot;It was intimidating, and I had to strip away some of the fear. Once I could put that behind me, it was very humbling. I realised I have so much to learn but now have a better sense of what I can bring to music. It was hugely interesting for us to talk about our different musical backgrounds. We really had to be honest about our strong points and failings. We had a lot of respect for each other's stories. Although Simone has spent so much time practising, and was taught well since she was a little child, what we took delight in was finding so many common threads.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644185f1727e111ab6e1c692b7b6ef668f172060","amp;dn":"Simone+Dinnerstein+and+Tift+Merritt+-+Night+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644185f1727e111ab6e1c692b7b6ef668f172060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,65,133,241,114,126,17,26,182,225,198,146,183,182,239,102,143,23,32,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
