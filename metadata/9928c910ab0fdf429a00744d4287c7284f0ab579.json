With a potential audience in excess of 300 million to please, the most popular and enduring drama series and sitcoms have had to track the dramatic changes that have transformed America since the age of mass television began in the 1950s, so this more than an entertainment history, it's a social history of the 'United States of Television'.\n\nMan of the House traces the trajectory of the archetypal American dad from the breadwinning patriarch of the 'Honey I'm Home' 1950s to the angst-ridden, plate-spinning multitasker who has to build his home on the shifting sands of the 21st century. From the cast iron certainties and benign omniscience of Jim X (Father Knows Best) and Andy Griffith to the crippling anxieties and bad choices Tony Soprano and Homer Simpson, Man of the House takes us on the rollercoaster ride of six decades of American masculinity. Includes interviews with legendary creators, stars, writers and producers: Ron Howard (The Andy Griffith Show), David Lynch (Twin Peaks), Rob Reiner (The Dick Van Dyke Show), David Chase (The Sopranos), John Hamm (Mad Men). James L. Brooks (The Simpsons) and many more.\n\n**********\n\nSize: 577,085,440 bytes (550.352 MB)\nPlay duration: 00:58:22 (3502.08 s)\nXviD\nac3\nDigital Cable HDTV\n\n**********\n\nTHIS IS MY OWN DIGITAL CABLE HDTV RECORDING AND ENCODE.\n\nIF YOU WANT THE INFERIOR X264 VERSION, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nDON'T COMPLAIN.
