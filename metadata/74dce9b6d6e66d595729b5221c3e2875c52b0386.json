Their chance at super-stardom comes after they buy a T-shirt with a winning golden tag allowing them to perform with Real Deal, the most legendary rapper in the World. The only problem is, Kevin, an equally sized Jewish kid with dreams of singing and blinging, manages to steal the prized White T and has his own plans to perform at the concert. With the help of a gypsy, a goat, and cast of characters as big as Herbert and HenryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appetites, White T is a feel good urban adventure reminiscent of Dude WhereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Car, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB Rating: 2.9/10 from 31 users\nDirected by: Lance Frank\nStarring: Jamal Mixon, Jerod Mixon, Eric Roberts\n\nRelease Name: White.T.2013.DVDRip.XviD-IGUANA\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: AVI | 640Ãƒâ€”272 | 833 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 192 kbps\nRuntime: 93 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74dce9b6d6e66d595729b5221c3e2875c52b0386","amp;dn":"White+T+2013+DVDRip+XviD-IGUANA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74dce9b6d6e66d595729b5221c3e2875c52b0386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,220,233,182,214,230,109,89,87,41,181,34,28,62,40,117,197,43,3,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
