But keeping knowledge private is increasingly tough. \nBradley Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of State Department cables\nto Wikileaks, and they all fit easily on a USB memory stick. At no time in \nhistory has the individual had so much power when confronting corrupt \ninstitutions.\n\nIt is effectively impossible for any organization to prevent its private \ninformation from leaking if someone stands to benefit from the leak.  In all \ncomplex organizations, there are internal politics, external competitors, and \nvarious other factors that will eventually encourage someone to grab the \ndata and run. \n\nOrganizations that have a lot to hide, and face existential risk if their \nsecrets are revealed, are the most likely to resort to severe intimidation to \ndiscourage anyone from leaking data.  It is notable that Julian Assange, \nand Bradley Manning are labelled &quot;terrorists&quot; simply for telling the truth \nabout the actions of the USA.  I believe the truth is that the Government of \nthe USA is terrified that if the people of USA find out what is being done \n&quot;in the name of the people&quot;, those citizens will be ashamed, and will dissolve the\ncorrupt institutions and put their leaders in jail for the rest of their natural \nlives.\n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Lesson Before Dying\nA Man for All Seasons\nA Medieval Life\nA Midsummer NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream\nA MidwifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tale\nA Million Little Pieces\nA Modest Proposal\nAn Ideal Husband\nI Am the Cheese\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\nI Never Promised You a Rose Garden\nI Stand Here Ironing\nI, Rigoberta Menchu\nIn Cold Blood\nIn Our Time\nIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\nInferno\nInherit the Wind\nInterpreter of Maladies\nInto Thin Air\nInvisible Man\nIola Leroy\nIsland of the Blue Dolphins\nIvanhoe\nJane Eyre\nJazz\nJohnny Got His Gun\nJohnny Tremain\nJourney into the Whirlwind\nJude the Obscure\nJulius Caesar\nJurassic Park\nKidnapped\nKindred\nKing John\nKing Lear\nKrik?
