Covered in blood and drenched in the icy waters of Lake Superior, she claims to have narrowly escaped a cold-blooded killer.\n\nStrideÃƒâ€ s raw instinct is to protect Cat, whose late parentsÃƒâ€  case ÃƒÂ» and his personal guilt associated with it ÃƒÂ» still sends a shiver down his spine. As a result, he takes the troubled teenager under his wing without as much as a second thought.\n\nHowever, StrideÃƒâ€ s partner Maggie Bei is not convinced. She doubts the sincerity of this beautiful young streetwalker who has so easily won StrideÃƒâ€ s trust, and now sleeps in his house with a butcherÃƒâ€ s knife under her pillow.\nAs Stride continues to care for Cat, MaggieÃƒâ€ s suspicions solidify, and a single question occupies the void between them: should Stride be afraid for, or of, this terribly damaged girl?\n \n           \n              Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it \n\n\nScreen:\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAMJhaaem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAMJhaaem&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;      &amp; \n*Comments are always welcome\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nVisit my Thread of Daily Update Uploads:\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b61152c8ce7a45003c16bc8cfef48edb4906cf","amp;dn":"The+Cold+Nowhere-Brian+Freeman+PDF-EPUB-MOBI%5BOrion_Me%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b61152c8ce7a45003c16bc8cfef48edb4906cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,182,17,82,200,206,122,69,0,60,22,188,140,254,244,142,219,73,6,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
