Collectors treasured rare singles before Nuggets, but the series created an aesthetic that emphasized the raw, trippy, wild, and woolly over the soft, lush, harmony-laden psychedelicized sounds of AM pop radio. The Rubble Collection, Mindrockers, The Trash Box -- all of them were dedicated to freaky guitar rock, and that mindset ruled until the latter half of the '90s, when the well had started to run dry, as labels like Sundazed issued the complete recorded works of obscure garage rockers who had released only one single during their lifetimes. Around this time, collectors -- including many third-generation music fanatics raised in the era of CD reissues rather than record fairs -- began to favor the soft sunshine pop of the late '60s, when square vocal groups started to get hip and record trippy music. Bands like the Millennium, the Association, and Yellow Balloon became hip currency, as did producers like Curt Boettcher and songwriters like Paul Williams. This was close to anathema for the hardcore garage rock fiends because this was not rock &amp; roll, it was pop music whose commercial aspirations failed. Nevertheless, most hardcore record geeks have a fondness for this stuff, since it's not only melodic and well produced, but it's terribly interesting to hear how underground ideas were borrowed and assimilated into mainstream music; often, it's as strange as it was in the underground, if not stranger. Fans of this breed of psychedelic pop were insatiable, and there was a certain thrill to the fact that it was hard to track down, since it was either issued in Japan, buried as album tracks on reissues, or never made it to CD at all. That's why Rhino Handmade's foray into the sound with Hallucinations: Psychedelic Pop Nuggets from the WEA Vaults and its companion release, Come to the Sunshine: Soft Pop Nuggets from the WEA Vaults, is so welcome -- while they're only available as limited editions (primarily sold via www.rhinohandmade.com), they're also the first widely available American samplers of this style. That alone would make them noteworthy, but what makes them essential (at least for hardcore record collectors), is that they're expertly done. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.96% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tRHM2 7818\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Harpers Bizarre - Come To The Sunshine\n02.Pat Shannon - Candy Apple, Cotton Candy\n03.The Salt - A Whole Lot Of Rainbows\n04.Morning Glories - Love-In\n05.The Everly Brothers - Talking To The Flowers\n06.The Munx - Our Dream\n07.Lee Mallory - Take My Hand\n08.The Association - Come On In\n09.The Vogues - Just What I've Been Looking For\n10.Looking Glass - Silver And Sunshine (How Wonderful Is Our Love)\n11.Anita Kerr &amp; The Anita Kerr Singers - Happiness\n12.The Gas Company - If You Know What I Mean\n13.The Cookies - Wounded\n14.Other Voices - Hung Up On Love\n15.The Tokens - For All That I Am\n16.The Street Corner Society - Summer Days, Summer Nights\n17.The Bonniwell Music Machine - Discrepency\n18.The Holy Mackerel - Scorpio Red\n19.Uncle Sound - Beverly Hills\n20.Dino, Desi &amp; Billy - Tell Someone That You Love Them\n21.Addrisi Brothers - Time To Love\n22.The Monkees - Someday Man\n23.The Coronados - Trip To Loveland\n24.Gates Of Eden - No One Was There (Requiem)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b25c0328ec175fc375f928ee4be20b91048134","amp;dn":"VA+-+Come+To+The+Sunshine+Soft+Pop+Nuggets+%282004%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b25c0328ec175fc375f928ee4be20b91048134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,178,92,3,40,236,23,95,195,117,249,40,238,75,226,11,145,4,129,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
