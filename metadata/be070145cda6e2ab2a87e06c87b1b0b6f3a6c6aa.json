There were 5 episodes released under &quot;Dark Water&quot; as a mini series before it was enhanced and made into a movie and then WB released a 21 episode cartoon series.\n\nThis is a ripped from my VHS recording so it's grainy and a bit fuzzy; I apologize.\n\nThis video is not meant to break any copyright laws out there (or other laws) I'm only posting it for viewer enjoyment and nostalgia.\n\n(c)Hanna Barbra and Warner Brothers and others associated with it. Credit Fox Kids for airing the series.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A RIP FROM THE WB DVD RELEASE OF THE SERIES!!!!!\n Compare the two first episodes. There are several significant differences, one being the quality of the animation!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be070145cda6e2ab2a87e06c87b1b0b6f3a6c6aa","amp;dn":"Dark+Water+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be070145cda6e2ab2a87e06c87b1b0b6f3a6c6aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,7,1,69,205,166,226,171,42,135,224,108,135,177,176,182,243,166,198,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
