Jeff Timmons added that, despite their updated sound, the guys havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t changed much since their 1.0 days. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the same guys. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re entertainers, singers, trying to evolve musically. Same guys, just a different era and, you know, trying to come up with new, cool stuff,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said.\nSome of that new, cool stuff includes their unexpectedly cheeky single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Microphone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as working with a new pack of hitmakers like Ne-Yo and Bruno Mars to add some new-millennium sparkle to their signature sound.&quot;\n\n1.
