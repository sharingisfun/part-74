The Spot used his evil witchcraft to kill off or entrance the minds of American scientists. He could travel as a bat and went into the home of Dr. Moore to kill him. While being stabbed, Moore somehow managed to throw the switch, giving life to his creation. The Yellow Spot's fiendish plan was put to a stop by Dynamic Man, who released the trapped minds of the other scientists and eliminated the Yellow Spot, who could only be killed in his bat form.\n\nSecond Version \nHigh school basketball coach Bert McQuade get put through a series of treatments by Dr. Stahl. These result in Bert gaining super powers. Bert puts on a costume and, with brother Ricky as his sidekick, Dynamic Boy, fights crime.\nPowers and AbilitiesEdit\n\nIn both cases, the Dynamic Man could fly, was strong enough to lift a car, and was invulnerable to bullets and acid. The first origin had above-average intelligence by the virtue of being an android.\n\nGolden Age Appearances \n\n    Dynamic Comics #1-3, 8-20 (Chesler) 21-24 (Superior)\n    Daring Adventures #10-11 (I.W.
