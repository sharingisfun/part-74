We received a phone call from Peru saying that my aunt Sibila was in prison accused of forming part of the Shining Path. I was seven years old and my parent's protective silence made me transform her image into a great mystery. She was kept in prision for 15 years. Today she is free and I want to get close to her, to listen and to understand.&quot;\n\n-- Teresa Arredondo, director. and Sybila's niece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451347df4600007d607f303bc82c3bd98724f325","amp;dn":"Sibila+%282012%29+DVD+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451347df4600007d607f303bc82c3bd98724f325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,19,71,223,70,0,0,125,96,127,48,59,200,44,59,217,135,36,243,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
