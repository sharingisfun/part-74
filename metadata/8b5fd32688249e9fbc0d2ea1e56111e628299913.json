(Had to say it!) I've uploaded every First Comics series (sans reprint titles) that I can find with the exception of two, 'Dreadstar' and 'Lone Wolf and Cub', and they are available at good speeds here at TPB:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4555571/Dreadstar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4555571/Dreadstar&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4817271/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4817271/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub&lt;/a&gt; (this is the Dark Horse collection)\n\nWhat's left are three issues of a series based on a short-lived cartoon, a few graphic novels and some odds and ends. They are: \n\nFilmation's Ghostbusters #1-3 (because 'Original Ghostbusters' just wasn't enough ghostbusting)\n\nLone Wolf &amp; Cub #10 &amp; #12 (original First Comics issues)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles GN #1-4 (colored collections of early B&amp;W Turtle comics)\n\nAdventures in Oz (collecting the excellent Eric Shanower minis done for First and Dark Horse)\n\nBeowulf GN (adapted by Jerry Bingham)\n\nMazinger GN (manga, giant-robot)\n\nMunden's Bar Annual #1 (from my 'First Wanted' file - Thanks for the find, BK!)\n\nThe Gift - A First Holiday Special (starring various and sundry First characters)\n\nTime^2 - The Epiphany &amp; Time^2 - The Satisfaction of Black Mariah (graphic novels written and illustrated by Howard Chaykin!)\n\n\nAs usual, I've included a .txt file called 'First Missing' AND added a second, 'Eclipse Missing', in preparation for a future upload project. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the email included in the files. I'm gonna need all the help I can get for Eclipse, because they published TONNNNNS of shit. So check your drives and discs, forward the list to your digital-hoarder buddies and poke around in the 'Comics' section at those boutique torrent sites that you keep to yourself. THANK YOU!\n\nAnd dat's dat. As always, thanks to the creative teams and thanks to the original scanners. If you like the books, show it by keeping the torrents alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b5fd32688249e9fbc0d2ea1e56111e628299913","amp;dn":"First+Comics+Miscellaneous+%28First+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b5fd32688249e9fbc0d2ea1e56111e628299913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,95,211,38,136,36,158,159,188,13,46,161,229,97,17,230,40,41,153,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
