Thankfully, The Let Go, a Seattle-based Hip Hop trio comprised of rappers Kublakai and Type and producer Captain Midnite, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take such a played out approach in their recently released album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tomorrow Handles ThatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (though they do, on occasion dabble in rapping about rain and/or the lack of sunlight, among other tired Seattle-centric themes). Kublakai and Type somehow find a way to incorporate humor (the kind you actually laugh at, not the Ã¢â‚¬Å“oh, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clever Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ so prevalent in the genre) with the introspective observations that seem to be a staple of the subgenre.\n\nThe live-and-let go attitude is presented immediately by the intro track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Turning On YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which the sample sings a heartfelt, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turning on you and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brining you down.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Continuing with this train of thought is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standing Back,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the highlights of the album in which the vocalists speak on the pains of ending a relationship. The catchy chorus of, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave meÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but if you have to leave and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what you need to breathe then I ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gonna stand in your way,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exemplifies the optimistic view of life these guys subscribe to. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message culminates in the tell-it-like-it-is track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easy RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the inspirational Ã¢â‚¬Å“DesolationÃ¢â‚¬Å“, which summarize the philosophy of embracing lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenges but not allowing oneself to be bogged down by them.\n\nInterspersed between tracks similar to the aforementioned are songs that are pure hilarity. Some may say that this makes for an unfocused and incoherent effort, but I beg to differ. Thanks to this, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tomorrow Handles ThatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the most fully developed albums to come along in a good while, complete with an advertisement (Sponsor Words) ! Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poking fun at the America Fuck Yeah mindset (No Difference), discussing how to wreck a party one hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been invited to (Party Crashers), speaking on the art, and the difficulty, of picking up women drunk (Booty Fiend), or the dilemma of trying to hook up with oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend (No I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t). All the while, the listener is serenaded by the real star of the show, the sonic environment crafted by the polished and topic-appropriate production by Midnite.\n\nCheck it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d04b318e25cce2b7ed1a65d266b51ec3b72d91","amp;dn":"The+Let+Go+-+Tomorrow+Handles+That+Uncensored+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d04b318e25cce2b7ed1a65d266b51ec3b72d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,208,75,49,142,37,204,226,183,237,26,101,210,102,181,30,195,183,45,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
