The novel was inspired by the painting The Last Day of Pompeii by the Russian painterKarl Briullov, which Bulwer-Lytton had seen in Milan.[1] Once a very widely read book and now relatively neglected, it culminates in the cataclysmic destruction of the city ofPompeii by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nThe novel uses its characters to contrast the decadent culture of 1st-century Rome with both older cultures and coming trends. The protagonist, Glaucus, represents the Greeks who have been subordinated by Rome, and his nemesis Arbaces the still older culture of Egypt. Olinthus is the chief representative of the nascent Christian religion, which is presented favorably but not uncritically. The Witch of Vesuvius, though she has no supernatural powers, shows Bulwer-Lytton's interest in the occult - a theme which would emerge in his later writing, particularly The Coming Race.\n\nSpecial ThanxXx to Mr. X for his work on proof-reading this title!\n\nPLEASE NOTE, I AM LOOKING FOR NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS TO PROOF-CHECK AND CORRECT THE ENGLISH TEXT OF UPCOMING HUNGARIAN COMICS SCANLATIONS, AND/OR CUSTOM SUBTITLES.\n\nIF INTERESTED, I CAN SEND YOU SOME SAMPLES. email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;592a2e382d2c2b38192038313636773a3634&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aecd3ba7e23ab15395b6880e8cbf1b52da8219e","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+of+Pompeii+%281984%29+Pompei+Utolso+Napjai+ENG+%28Zorad%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aecd3ba7e23ab15395b6880e8cbf1b52da8219e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,236,211,186,126,35,171,21,57,91,104,128,232,203,241,181,45,168,33,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
