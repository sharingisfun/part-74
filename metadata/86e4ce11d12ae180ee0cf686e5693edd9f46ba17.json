This is the film that Jules and Gedeon Naudet filmed in 2001 that started out as a documentry about a probie fireman in training for the New York Fire Department.\n \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis video was recorded off of a local CBS television network affiliate television station in the United States.\n\nThis video was recorded off of an OTA (Over The Air using a Television antenna for reception) television station which encountered a signal drop out during several parts of the recording. This resulted in pixelized images or a complete lose of the picture . This problem was successfully resolved by spicing in clips from the original CBS broadcast of the 2002 copy of the 9/11 film. There is a noticeable difference between the original chips and the 2011 clips. For instance, the CBS logo which has the appearance of an eyeball, is only present in the 2011 version of the film, while those lacking this logo were taken from the original 2002 version of the film--giving for the most part-- a complete copy of the film with no frames missing.\n\nBecause this film is an .AVI, the picture quality has been degraded somewhat. I plan on uploading an mpg. Copy of this film which will exhibit a higher video quality.
