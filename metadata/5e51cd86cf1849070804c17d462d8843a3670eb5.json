Enlisted by his psychotherapist boyfriend, Jonathan, Frank finds that Apsey may not necessarily be a quack, after all. The reason for Frank's seeing Apsey becomes blurred is it for the article or for personal reasons? As Frank falls under Apsey's spell, his relationship with Jonathan deteriorates, and a fierce psychological tug of war erupts between the two persuasive doctors over the heart of mind of Frank. Frank must make decisions that eventually explode the lives of all of them.\n\n\n01:43:49\n512x288\n29.97 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e51cd86cf1849070804c17d462d8843a3670eb5","amp;dn":"2002+Fixing+Frank+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e51cd86cf1849070804c17d462d8843a3670eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,81,205,134,207,24,73,7,8,4,193,125,70,45,136,67,163,103,14,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
