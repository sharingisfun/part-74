The Power of Belief\nNote: These are the MP3 files provided by Coast to Coast AM's website. I am curious to see which format people enjoy better. Do you like the previous bumper music version? Or would you rather have it as the original mp3s. Let me know in the comments please! \nSo far, MP3 version wins!\n\nCurtecy of Coast to Coast Am's wonderful  &quot;Coast Insider&quot; service!\nShow description:\nA doctor of psychology, and metaphysics, \nEldon Taylor,\ndiscussed his work researching the mind-body connection, and how science is repeatedly demonstrating the power of belief. What you hold to be true can and does have a huge impact on the quality of your life, and can either sabotage or serve you, he argued. &quot;The more research I did, the more I realized that there is no such thing as an inconsequential belief,&quot; he remarked, noting that even though we may segment our beliefs into different categories, such\nas politics, or people, they form into a large web. &quot;You tweak one belief in one place, it causes the entire web to vibrate,&quot; he said. \n\nHe cited an intriguing study first done by the University of Washington in Seattle in which they created a bar, with attractive liquor displays. Students\nin the experiment were encouraged to try out different drinks, and after having a few, they exhibited changed behaviors, such as lowered inhibitions. After\n3-4 drinks, motor skills were seriously impaired, and they acted drunk. Yet, the students didn't actually drink any alcohol-- only the rims of the glasses\nwere dipped in alcohol to create the smell. &quot;The expectation that you were drinking alcohol, combined with what you thought your limit might be, created\nthis drunkenness,&quot; Taylor explained. Another study that demonstrates the surprising action of belief expectation is the \nCheckershadow Illusion.\n\nWe all have implicit biases, such as dealing with race, sex, and age which can predetermine our expectations, and even cause us to see things that aren't\nthere, Taylor continued. While the 'Law of Attraction' has some validity, people need to take action to achieve their goals and not just try to wish something\ninto being, he commented. Further, negative events that occur to a person aren't necessarily things they've consciously or unconsciously brought into their\nlives, he commented. Though some have suggested that life shouldn't be a struggle, we often gain a lot of strength through a &quot;trial by fire,&quot; and sometimes\nit's within the struggle that we find our meaning, Taylor added. \n\nGun Crimes &amp; Control\n\nFirst hour guest, research scientist \nJohn Lott\n commented on a new \nstudy\n which showed that gun-related crimes have fallen sharply over the last 20 years in the United States, even though most Americans believe they've actually\nrisen. Media coverage of crimes (&quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot;) may have contributed to this misconception, he suggested. Lott also offered criticism of the\nObama administration's push for gun control, such as through increased background checks. \n\nNews segment guests: \nJerome Corsi,\nDr. Peter Breggin,\nRoger Tolces\n\nWebsite(s):\n eldontaylor.com\n\nBook(s):\n I Believe: When What You Believe Matters! \n Self-Hypnosis And Subliminal Technology\n What Does That Mean?: Exploring Mind, Meaning, and Mysteries \n At the Brink\n More Guns, Less Crime\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c77ddbbb5448d2be1f719c732510757c0ce82d","amp;dn":"%28Full+stream%29+Coast+to+Coast+AM+04-19-2013+Imperfect+Spirit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c77ddbbb5448d2be1f719c732510757c0ce82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,199,125,219,187,84,72,210,190,31,113,156,115,37,16,117,124,12,232,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
