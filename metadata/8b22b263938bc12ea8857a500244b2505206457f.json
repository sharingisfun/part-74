He now finds the same deep fulfillment in cooking and entertaining that he once found in skating.\n\nHis adventures abroad influence his own style of cooking, as does his Italian heritage, where great food has always been a key part of any gathering. Some of BoitanoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite food memories revolve around family get-togethers, and his cookbook includes personal vignettes and dishes that are inspired by memorable family recipes.\n\nThe recipes in What Would Brian Boitano Make? emphasize taste, convenience, and nutrition. Boitano pairs intriguing flavors and textures, playing with the balance of opposites to add complexity to his recipes.\n\nWhile gourmet in taste, the ingredients are easily accessible to any home cook. Mouthwatering recipes include: Paella Sliders, Crab-and-Avocado Crostini, Blood Orange Mojito, Butternut Squash Soup with Goat Cheese Toasts, Heirloom Tomato Cantaloupe and Feta Salad, Summer Squash Risotto with Grilled Lemon Basil Chicken, Pork Tenderloin with Warm Plum Salsa, Salmon with Pea and Basil Pesto, and Coconut Flan. \n\n                Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it\n\n\nScreen:\n\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAmlOaaEK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAmlOaaEK&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;      &amp; \n*Comments are always welcome\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nVisit my Thread of Daily Updated Uploads:\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b22b263938bc12ea8857a500244b2505206457f","amp;dn":"What+Would+Brian+Boitano+Make%3F%3AFresh+and+Fun+Recipes+for+Sharing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b22b263938bc12ea8857a500244b2505206457f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,34,178,99,147,139,193,46,168,133,122,80,2,68,178,80,82,6,69,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
