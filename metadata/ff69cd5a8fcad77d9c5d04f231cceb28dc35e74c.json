The announcement of VernonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return is sure to sing a sweet falsetto to the ears of many. However, Grownass Man is hardly what Bon IverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s introspective following might have expected. This fresh, blues-rock album by the trio who initially formed brie\u001cfly for an unreleased EP in 2008, confidently soars clear of any pigeonhole into which they might otherwise be stu\u001effed.\n\n\nVernon, joined by Phil Cook (Megafaun) and Brian Moen (Peter Wolf Crier) present an album which mocks any notion of a musical comfort zone and stretches the limits of breadth that one record can handle. From the distorted grungy tones of Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeaven KnowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to the spunky country beat of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMother, When?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, VernonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intention is clear - to take a break from the earnestness of Bon Iver towards something a little more light hearted and a little more anonymous. Where Bon Iver was intense and brooding, \u001fThe Shouting Matches relies on ad-hoc synth ri\u001effs and cranks up the distortion for a genuine band-practise-in-the garage style.\n\n\nIncorporating the rock styles of The Rolling Stones or \u001fThe Who in opening track Ã¢â‚¬ËœAvery HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or with the slightly unpolished blues jam of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ\u001fThree Dollar BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, \u001fThe Shouting Matches really do scream, or rather soulfully wail, of a bunch of guys who between them enjoy a far-reaching and diverse appetite for music, whilst having a jolly good time indulging it. In an album which, thanks to minimal promotion, bears as few expectations as possible for a double Grammy award winning artist, Vernon and the band are free to explore the wilds of their musical tastebuds to their hearts and ears contents.\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing breakaway comes from Ã¢â‚¬ËœNew ThemeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a track which couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be any newer for Vernon if it was wrapped in cellophane and topped with a shiny red bow. The carefree lindy-hop antidote to a career dedicated to making melancholy beautiful, it kicks and \u001c flicks its way to a sunnier, if rather less eloquent and rather more gospel, side to VernonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive songwriting palate. The closing track eases the uncharacteristically boogying folk fan back into a more pensive and familiar place. Yet, inkeeping with the other nine, it does so in a wholly unfamiliar manner. \u001fThe soft swoon of Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Need a ChangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is slow-mo soul and it charms with the customary smoothness of yesteryear blues.\n\nBon Iver this most certainly is not. Neither is it the kind of groundbreaking stuff\u001e that made Justin Vernon such a big hit. But a whimsical scrapbook to a long list of musical loves and an exciting venture which mingles the new with the really rather retro, this might just be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff69cd5a8fcad77d9c5d04f231cceb28dc35e74c","amp;dn":"The+Shouting+Matches+-+Grownass+Man+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff69cd5a8fcad77d9c5d04f231cceb28dc35e74c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,105,205,90,143,202,215,125,156,93,4,242,49,204,235,40,220,53,231,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
