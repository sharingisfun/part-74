In its transition from rich biodiversity to the barren, cold land of blizzards we see today, Antarctica provides a dramatic case study of how subtle changes in continental positioning can affect living communities, and how rapidly catastrophic changes can come about.\nFrozen in Time presents a comprehensive overview of the fossil record of Antarctica framed within its changing environmental settings, providing a window into a past time and environment on the continent. It reconstructs AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolving animal and plant communities as accurately as the fossil record permits.\nThe story of how fossils were first discovered in Antarctica is a triumph of human endeavor. It continues today with modern expeditions going out to remote sites every year to fill in more of the missing parts of the continentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great jigsaw of life.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* Copiously illustrated with magnificent color images\n* Provides an overview of the discovery and exploration of Antarctica\n* Gives a clear guide to the palaeontology of Antarctica\n* Includes contemporary issues of heritage and preservation\n* Outlines the possible major impacts of climate change\n\nCONTENTS\n1 The cold, barren land we call Antarctica\n2 A continent discovered\n3 The fossil pioneers\n4 AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest fossils\n5 The age of fish and ferns\n6 A time of southern coal swamps\n7 Giant amphibians and hairy reptiles\n8 Volcanic lakes and early dinosaurs\n9 When dinosaurs ruled\n10 When giant reptiles swam in southern seas\n11 Killer birds, giant penguins and early mammals\n12 The big chill: from paradise to polar ice\n13 Life today in the frozen south\nEndnotes, Glossary, References, Index\n\nAbout the Authors &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://monash.edu/science/about/schools/geosciences/assets/images/directory/stillwell.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://monash.edu/science/about/schools/geosciences/assets/images/directory/stillwell.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nJeffrey D.
