Since then he has been doing regular cases with his &quot;Partner&quot;, Marcus Deckler (Sam Huntington).\n\nOne night, when teenager Elizabeth Ryan (Anita Briem) calls her father, without getting an answer, she goes to her father's room and finds him dead on the floor. She is then surprised, and almost attacked, by a strange, hairy, creature.\n\nThe next day, Dylan is informed, by Marcus, that Elizabeth asked for (and later hires) him. When Dylan interrogates her, she explains that he is the only one that can help her and shows to him a card (that is his old detective card) that says &quot;No pulse?, No problem&quot;. Dylan sees it, stands up and goes out, stating that he doesn't &quot;do that&quot; any more, followed by Marcus.\n\n\nMenu: Si\nLanguage: Ita, Eng\nSub: Ita, Eng\nExtra: Si\nFile: DVD9 1:1\nFile: Iso\n\nViewing / Installation Instructions\n\nUse VLC player to watch.\nOr you can burn to DVD with NERO or a similar program.
