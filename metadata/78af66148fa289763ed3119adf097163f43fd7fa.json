The stories centered on UFOs and other paranormal phenomenon. Though successful with fans and critics, the series only ran three issues due to the bankruptcy of First comics.\n\n\nEach of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!\n\nBig ups to the creators and scanners!
