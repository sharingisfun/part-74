Gatsby's youthful neighbor, Nick Carraway, fascinated with the display of enormous wealth in which Gatsby revels, finds himself swept up in the lavish lifestyle of Long Island society during the Jazz Age. Considered Fitzgerald's best work, The Great Gatsby is a mystical, timeless story of integrity and cruelty, vision and despair. Now available unabridged on CD, Alexander Scourby delivers Fitzgerald's story in &quot;one of the finest readings ever recorded&quot; (The New York Times).\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baee4598035ace8a7b04213bb3bc7f6a0542ac2f","amp;dn":"The+Great+Gatsby+-+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baee4598035ace8a7b04213bb3bc7f6a0542ac2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,238,69,152,3,90,206,138,123,4,33,59,179,188,127,106,5,66,172,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
