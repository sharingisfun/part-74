Netizel would later find another collection of transcriptions, twice as extensive, in the National Archive in Washington. These were discoveries that would provide a unique and profoundly important window into the true mentality of the soldiers in the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the German navy, and the military in general -- almost all of whom had insisted on their own honourable behaviour during the war. \nCollaborating with renowned social psychologist Harald Welzer, Neitzel examines these conversations -- and the casual, pitiless brutality omnipresent in them -- from a historical and psychological perspective, and in reconstucting the frameworks and situations behind these conversations, they have created a powerful narrative of wartime experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f676df77e0c30cfee051b67069af02ded62dcdef","amp;dn":"Soldaten+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f676df77e0c30cfee051b67069af02ded62dcdef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,118,223,119,224,195,12,254,224,81,182,112,105,175,2,222,214,45,205,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
