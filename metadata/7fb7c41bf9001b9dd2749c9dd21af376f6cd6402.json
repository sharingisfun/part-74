Behemoth were formed during 1991 (originally as a trio), and began issuing several demos shortly thereafter, the most circulated one being 1993's From the Pagan Vastlands. The same year, Behemoth issued their debut release (via the Italian independent record label Entropy), And the Forests Dream Eternally. Two years later, the group released its first full-length recording, Sventevith, which received favorable reviews by the metal underground press. For 1996's Grom, Behemoth widened their musical vision by experimenting with acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and female vocalists, but all the while retained their brutal, extreme metal sound, leading to the group's inaugural full-on tour of Europe. Released in 1997, the three-track stopgap EP Bewitching the Pomerania proved to be the first recording to feature drummer Inferno, who would soon become a driving force (and permanent fixture) in Behemoth. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tMp3 320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01....Of My Worship (Intro)\n02.Summoning Of The Ancient Gods\n03.The Arrival (Instrumental)\n04.Dark Triumph\n05.Monumentum (Instrumental)\n06.Rise Of The Blackstorm Of Evil\n07.Aggressor\n08.Goat With A Thousand Young (Instrumental)\n09.Bless Thee For Granting Me Pain\n10.Cursed Angel Of Doom (Re-Recorded)\n11.Transylvanian Forest (Re-Recorded)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.From Hornedlands To Lindisfarne\n02.Thy Winter Kingdom\n03.Summoning (Of The Ancient Ones)\n04.The Dance Of The Pagan Flames\n05.Blackvisions Of The Almighty\n06.Fields Of Haar-Meggido\n07.Deathcrush\n08.Moonspell Rites (Alternative Version)\n09.Blackvisions Of The Almighty (Alternative Version)\n10.Pure Evil &amp; Hate (Alternative Version)\n11.The Oak Between The Snows (Instrumental)\n12.Spellcraft &amp; Heathendom (Re-Recorded)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb7c41bf9001b9dd2749c9dd21af376f6cd6402","amp;dn":"Behemoth+-+Demonica+2CD+%282007%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb7c41bf9001b9dd2749c9dd21af376f6cd6402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,183,196,27,249,0,27,157,210,116,156,157,210,26,243,118,246,205,100,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
