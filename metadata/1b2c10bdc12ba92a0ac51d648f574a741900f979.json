Four of these performances were previously unreleased and \nsix were on Live Sky (one of those six, &quot;She's a Dancer&quot;, was edited for \nlength on Live Sky but appears here in its entirety); the tapes were \ncompletely remixed and remastered by bassist Joe Macre for this release.\n\nTLSCU note:\nDeleted track Maybe I Can Fool Everybody (Tonight) was added back to this \nrecording from the bonus Live Sky tracks from the 1988 Live WBAB as it was \nable to fit the time needed to burn this expanded album to a single CD with \n11 tracks. Some small volume adjustments were needed for this track to match\nthe 2006 remixes volume.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by John Palumbo, except where noted. \nNo. \tTitle\n1. \t&quot;Hold On&quot;   \t \n2. \t&quot;Mind Baby&quot;  \n3. \t&quot;Maybe I Can Fool Everybody (Tonight) [TLSCU bonus track)\n4. \t&quot;Lighten Up McGraw&quot; (Rob Stevens, Rick Witkowski, Joe Macre) \t\n5. \t&quot;She's a Dancer&quot;   \t \n6. \t&quot;Nuclear Apathy&quot;   \t \n7. \t&quot;Ice&quot;   \t \n8. \t&quot;Long Nights&quot;   \t \n9. \t&quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; (Macre, Witkowski) \t \n10. \t&quot;Surf City&quot;   \t \n11. \t&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) \t \n\nPersonnel\n\n    Rick Witkowski - Lead guitar\n    Joe Macre - Bass guitar, harmonies\n    Jim Griffiths - Lead guitar, harmonies\n    Joey D'Amico - Drums, harmonies\n    Vince DePaul - Keyboards\n    Gary Lee Chappell - Lead vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2c10bdc12ba92a0ac51d648f574a741900f979","amp;dn":"Crack+the+Sky+-+Live+Sky+%5BAlive+And+Kickin%27+Ass+TLSCU+2012+Delux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2c10bdc12ba92a0ac51d648f574a741900f979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,44,16,189,193,43,169,42,10,197,29,100,143,87,74,116,25,0,249,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
