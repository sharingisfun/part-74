Name's Gomez. I'm a cat. But in an age of magic, nothing's quite what it seems. Predators and crooks take a hundred new forms...so do the heroes.\nIt was a new town, new turf for an old stray tom. I came to Denver looking for a fresh start, but what I found was criminal: Susan Jacobs, a beautiful, ambitious young broadcaster meeting a car bomb that blew more then her ratings sky high. I needed this case like I needed a hairball, but Jacob's sexy calico, a purrfect kitty with lambent golden eyes, needed ME. So, with a Zippo-snapping, studded leather rebel cop named Leventhal, I'm prowling among political wackos, religious nuts, media weasels, talking snakes, gutter sorcerers, wannabe wizards...on a cat-and-mouse hunt for a killer. And when I find who it is, the fur's gonna fly.\n\nI reformatted the PDF workerbee found, split it into chapters, made a chapter menu and cleaned the spacings/indents.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606aff5c284dd2a07ed6ea74d64c14452c26e37f","amp;dn":"The+Nine+Lives+of+Catseye+Gomez+-+Simon+Hawke.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606aff5c284dd2a07ed6ea74d64c14452c26e37f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,106,255,92,40,77,210,160,126,214,234,116,214,76,20,69,44,38,227,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
