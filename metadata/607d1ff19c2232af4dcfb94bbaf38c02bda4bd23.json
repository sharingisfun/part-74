It is composed predominantly of free and open source software, and supports community involvement.\n\nThe design approach of the development team focuses on simplicity from a developer's standpoint rather than a user's standpoint, elegance, code correctness, and minimalism. A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.\n\nArch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up to date snapshots of the main system components.\n---\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607d1ff19c2232af4dcfb94bbaf38c02bda4bd23","amp;dn":"archlinux-2013.04.01-dual.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607d1ff19c2232af4dcfb94bbaf38c02bda4bd23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,125,31,241,156,34,50,175,77,207,185,75,186,243,140,2,189,164,189,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
