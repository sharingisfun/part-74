R. Martin and read by Roy Doltrice (Except the last book, which i believe is read by John Lee). It was put together based on other torrents, but the file names and ID3 tags have been corrected to ensure everything is in order.\n\nMP3 format at 64KB, in my opinion the audio is perfectly fine for listening but you may want to double the audio volume in VLC or iTunes if listening on a laptop. I think this is the best torrent for anyone wanting the complete set.\n\nI took the time to rename all the files so that they are in perfect order. If you are downloading, please seed to 100%.\n\n1 - Game of Thrones - Roy Doltrice\n2 - A Clash Of Kings - Roy Doltrice\n3 - A Storm of Swords - Roy Doltrice\n4 - A Feast for Crows - Roy Doltrice\n5 - A Dance with Dragons - John Lee (?)\n\nIt will take 8.3 days to listen to them all, enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de10b49d5ff92db5ae6065ffe855da32a440bd0","amp;dn":"As+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire+%28Audio+Book+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de10b49d5ff92db5ae6065ffe855da32a440bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,225,11,73,213,255,146,219,90,230,6,95,254,133,93,163,42,68,11,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
