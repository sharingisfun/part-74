Never mind the fact that the way to your destination is littered with dusty space castles, claustrophobic cellars, and vertigo-inducing rooftops. On your way to the next interstellar bus stop, you'll meet a cast of eccentric, equally lost robots that speaks of the mysteriously absent Major, a staircase to the moon, and a missing bus manager. Who sabotaged the public transportation system? What are those strange noises coming from the moon? Will you ever make it back home?\n\nPid is a platform-adventure with a unique mechanic - the Gravity Beam. Using the Gravity Beam, you can create thin fields of gravity that help you overcome obstacles, manipulate your enemies, and put yourself out of their reach. Use stealth in order to get past the roving patrols of robots and their inquisitive light beams. One false move and you'll be caught and the next interstellar bus will go on without you!\n\nNotice: The game fully supports gamepads.\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: EVERYONE 10+ with Cartoon Violence.
