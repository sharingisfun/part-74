Instead, she finds the ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suite occupied by the last person she wants to see.\n\nCarly Williams and Michelle were once inseparable, until a shocking betrayal destroyed their friendship. And now Carly is implicated in the financial disaster lurking behind the innÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheerful veneer.\n\nSingle mother Carly has weathered rumors, lies and secrets for a lifetime, and is finally starting to move forward with love and life. But if the Blackberry Island Inn goes under, Carly and her daughter will go with it.\n\nTo save their livelihoods, Carly and Michelle will undertake a turbulent truce.

Now the proud-ish owner of the ugly duckling of the trio, she plans to open her own pediatric office on the first floor, just as soon as her hunky contractor completes the work. Andi's new future may be coming together, but the truth is she's just as badly in need of a major renovation as her house. \n\nWhen Deanna Phillips confronts her husband about a suspected affair, she opens up a Pandora's Box of unhappiness. And he claims that she is the problem. The terrible thing is, he's right. In her quest to be the perfect woman, she's lost herself, and she's in danger of losing her entire family if things don't change. \n\nNext door, artist Boston King thought she and her college sweetheart would be married forever.
