He experiments with everything from structure to narrative to color. If you're unfamiliar with his work, he's sort of like Gary Panter illustrating a Chris Ware story, or, in this case, 3 stories of dystopian societies.\n\n-----\n\nVery different comic from what I've read, and I'm pretty sure there aren't many like this. I wasn't fondof the second story, but I enjoyed the first one a lot and thought the third one was okay. Give it a try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf651597ee68f4f80f9850acc40bcc1f1155e09","amp;dn":"3+New+Stories+%282013%29+%28c2c%29+%28Monafekk+Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf651597ee68f4f80f9850acc40bcc1f1155e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,246,81,89,126,230,143,79,128,249,133,10,204,64,188,193,241,21,94,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
