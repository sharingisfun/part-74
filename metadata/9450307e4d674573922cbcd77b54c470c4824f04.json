The Best of Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers\n  \n  Reggae's most transcendent and iconic figure, Bob Marley was the first Jamaican artist to achieve international superstardom, in the process introducing the music of his native island nation to the far-flung corners of the globe. Marley's music gave voice to the day-to-day struggles of the Jamaican experience, vividly capturing not only the plight of the country's impoverished and oppressed but also the devout spirituality that remains their source of strength. His songs of faith, devotion, and revolution created a legacy that continues to live on not only through the music of his extended family but also through generations of artists the world over touched by his genius.\n\n  Robert Nesta Marley was born February 6, 1945, in rural St. Ann's Parish, Jamaica; the son of a middle-aged white father and teenaged black mother, he left home at 14 to pursue a music career in Kingston, becoming a pupil of local singer and devout Rastafarian Joe Higgs. He cut his first single, &quot;Judge Not,&quot; in 1962 for Leslie Kong, severing ties with the famed producer soon after over a monetary dispute. In 1963 Marley teamed with fellow singers Peter Tosh, Bunny Livingston, Junior Braithwaite, Beverly Kelso, and Cherry Smith to form the vocal group the Teenagers; later rechristened the Wailing Rudeboys and later simply the Wailers, they signed on with producer Coxsone Dodd's legendary Studio One and recorded their debut, &quot;I'm Still Waiting.&quot; When Braithwaite and Smith exited the Wailers, Marley assumed lead vocal duties, and in early 1964 the group's follow-up, &quot;Simmer Down,&quot; topped the Jamaican charts. A series of singles including &quot;Let Him Go (Rude Boy Get Gail),&quot; &quot;Dancing Shoes,&quot; &quot;Jerk in Time,&quot; &quot;Who Feels It Knows It,&quot; and &quot;What Am I to Do&quot; followed, and in all, the Wailers recorded some 70 tracks for Dodd before disbanding in 1966. On February 10 of that year, Marley married Rita Anderson, a singer in the group the Soulettes; she later enjoyed success as a member of the vocal trio the I-Threes. Marley then spent the better part of the year working in a factory in Newark, DE, the home of his mother since 1963.\n\n  Upon returning to Jamaica that October, Marley re-formed the Wailers with Livingston and Tosh, releasing &quot;Bend Down Low&quot; on their own short-lived Wail 'N' Soul 'M label; at this time all three members began devoting themselves to the teachings of the Rastafari faith, a cornerstone of Marley's life and music until his death. Beginning in 1968, the Wailers recorded a wealth of new material for producer Danny Sims before teaming the following year with producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry; backed by Perry's house band, the Upsetters, the trio cut a number of classics, including &quot;My Cup,&quot; &quot;Duppy Conqueror,&quot; &quot;Soul Almighty,&quot; and &quot;Small Axe,&quot; which fused powerful vocals, ingenious rhythms, and visionary production to lay the groundwork for much of the Jamaican music in their wake. Upsetters bassist Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett and his drummer brother Carlton soon joined the Wailers full-time, and in 1971 the group founded another independent label, Tuff Gong, releasing a handful of singles before signing to Chris Blackwell's Island Records a year later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9450307e4d674573922cbcd77b54c470c4824f04","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9450307e4d674573922cbcd77b54c470c4824f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,80,48,126,77,103,69,115,146,44,188,215,123,84,196,112,196,130,79,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
