Smart keeps its water use and pollution to a minimum, and the cars are made from materials that can be recycled. The factory reuses heat generated by the machines to heat other parts of the plant.\n\nThe paints used on the body panels are watersoluble, so they use very little water and no chemical solvents. The company even has a recycling program in Europe for when the cars are too old to run. Smart Car owners can take their cars to Smartapproved recycling facilities, where the cars are taken apart and the materials reused or properly disposed of. The companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s factory, Smartville, in Hambach, France, was also built with the environment in mind. The builders used recycled materials wherever they could, and they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use a lot of dangerouschemical materials typically used in construction. The company also pledged to plant a tree for every Smart Car sold in 2008 and 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:712672f6a3a6d4842ecf7afdda719ec4d7d80d18","amp;dn":"Smart+Car+%28Green+Cars%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"712672f6a3a6d4842ecf7afdda719ec4d7d80d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,38,114,246,163,166,212,132,46,207,122,253,218,113,158,196,215,216,13,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
