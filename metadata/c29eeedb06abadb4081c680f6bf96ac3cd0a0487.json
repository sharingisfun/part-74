It stars Jang Dong-gun and Won Bin and tells the story of two brothers who are drafted in the South Korean army by force at the outbreak of the Korean War.\n\nThe music was composed by Dong-jun Lee, and released on February 23, 2004 as a single CD, produced by Yejeon Media in Korea and Avex Trax in Japan. It has 25 tracks, with seven bonus tracks, including a solo piano and chamber ensemble arrangement of the main theme. The &quot;haunting&quot; main theme's lyricism, present throughout several of the tracks, was compared favorably to music of film score composers Ennio Morricone and John Williams. Although it was received generally positively, one critic argued that the film was tragic enough already, and needed &quot;a more subtle soundtrack.&quot;\n\nBitrate: 320kbps\nSEED &amp; ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29eeedb06abadb4081c680f6bf96ac3cd0a0487","amp;dn":"Lee+Dong+Jun+-+Taegukgi+%28Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29eeedb06abadb4081c680f6bf96ac3cd0a0487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,158,238,219,6,171,173,180,8,28,104,15,107,249,106,195,205,10,4,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
