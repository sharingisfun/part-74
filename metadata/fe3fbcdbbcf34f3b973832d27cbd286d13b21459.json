Mixed with mellow acoustic moments, the result is a more dynamic album than Out of My Hands, but the long-running Matchbox 20 and Goo Goo Dolls comparisons are still merited. That said, the sleek, polished production paired with the urgent hooks and tight harmonies make for some singles that are perfectly geared toward adult alternative radio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3fbcdbbcf34f3b973832d27cbd286d13b21459","amp;dn":"Green+River+Ordinance+-+Under+Fire%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3fbcdbbcf34f3b973832d27cbd286d13b21459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,63,188,219,188,243,79,59,151,56,50,210,124,189,40,109,19,178,20,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
