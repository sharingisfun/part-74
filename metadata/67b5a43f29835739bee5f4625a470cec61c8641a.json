Also alot of EQ tweaking was done to produce a less tinny, more full sounding record, particularly for the guitars and bass guitar. I've done alot of more or less obvious things here, and used alot of tricks to achieve the sound.\nNo compressors used per se, though one effect I use helped to tame the snare drum dynamics. Also I decided for a fairly loud volume on the record, atleast compared to the original. The type of sound this album has, with loud thumpy sound, I feel responds well to this, with the final maximizer giving a bit more cohesiveness to the energy of the track, whilst only working on the parts that reach close to 0dB. It's still only occasionally clipping off peaks, and considering the almost completely flat uncompressed original I felt this was appropriate for my tastes.\n\n\nI hope this might be of benefit to someone, and do give me your comments and criticism if you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67b5a43f29835739bee5f4625a470cec61c8641a","amp;dn":"Testament+-+Practice+What+You+Preach+1989+%28Fan+Remaster%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67b5a43f29835739bee5f4625a470cec61c8641a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,181,164,63,41,131,87,57,190,229,244,98,90,71,12,236,97,200,100,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
