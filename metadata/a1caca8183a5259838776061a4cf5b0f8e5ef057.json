This time, the economics expert answers questions sent in by our viewers, diving further into economic inequality, the limitations of industry regulation, and the widening gap between a booming stock market and a population that increasingly lives in poverty.\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1caca8183a5259838776061a4cf5b0f8e5ef057","amp;dn":"What+Has+Capitalism+Done+for+Us+Lately%3F-PBS+Moyers+and+Company+0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1caca8183a5259838776061a4cf5b0f8e5ef057","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,202,202,129,131,165,37,152,56,119,96,97,164,207,91,15,142,94,240,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
