But you may not know the amazing story behind why you love some foods and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tolerate others. Now, in Taste What YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Missing, the first book that demystifies the science of taste, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how your individual biology, genetics, and brain create a personal experience of everything you tasteÃ¢â‚¬â€and how you can make the most of it.\nA seasoned food developer to whom food companies turn for help in creating delicious new products, Barb Stuckey reveals that much of what we think we know about how taste works is wrong. And the truth is much more fascinatingÃ¢â‚¬â€for instance, your tongue is not divided into quadrants for sweet, sour, salt, and bitter and only a fraction of what you taste happens in your mouth. As Stuckey explains how our five senses work together to form Ã¢â‚¬Å“flavor perceptions,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she tells intriguing stories about people who have lost the sense of smell or taste and the unexpected ways their experience of food changes as a result. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn why kids (and some adults) turn up their noses at Brussels sprouts and broccoli, how salt makes grapefruit sweet, and why you drink your coffee black while your spouse loads it with cream and sugar.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d385ded35460fc9602e29eb34b5f49d4556b0b3e","amp;dn":"Taste+What+You%27re+Missing%3A+The+Passionate+Eater%27s+Guide+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d385ded35460fc9602e29eb34b5f49d4556b0b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,133,222,211,84,96,252,150,2,226,158,179,75,95,73,212,85,107,11,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
