Heroes are dying, and cops are dying twofold. Humanity is under-powered and good people are suffering untold tragedies trying to stem the flow. Beat cop Leo Winters is one of those struggling to make a difference. And the answer just might come in the form of two lowlifes with a dark secret. A new ongoing series by award-winning author Mike Carey (X-MEN, THE UNWRITTEN) and fan-favorite artist Elena Casagrande (HULK, HACK/SLASH). SUICIDE RISK is a high octane, mind-bending series created by one of the industry's greatest storytellers.\n\nenjoy &amp; seed as long as possible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43b25d081804a2b63dbb639ba66425a60c91ea4","amp;dn":"Suicide+Risk+001+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28K6-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43b25d081804a2b63dbb639ba66425a60c91ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,59,37,208,129,128,74,43,99,219,182,57,186,102,66,90,96,201,30,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
