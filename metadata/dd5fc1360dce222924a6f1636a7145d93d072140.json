(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT THE FANZINE!!!!) \n\nSince Wikipedia is silent on the subject, allow me to recap:\n\nRob Lindsay, an average teen-ager, stumbles upon what appears to be an old comic premium: the mask of the Golden Age hero Alter Ego. When Rob dons the mask, he is trasported into a comic world and becomes Alter Ego, leading the &quot;Limbo Legion&quot; into battle against the Crimson Claw. The Claw has designs on conquering both the comic book world and Rob's &quot;real&quot; world, and he'll stop at nothing to do it.\n\nThis is a four-issue mini-series co-written by Roy and Dann Thomas, and illustrated by Ron Harris. This torrent contains the original mini AND the collected edition released by Heroic Publishing.\n\n\nEach of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!\n\nThank you creative team and scanners! Keep it alive please!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5fc1360dce222924a6f1636a7145d93d072140","amp;dn":"Alter+Ego+%28First+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5fc1360dce222924a6f1636a7145d93d072140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,95,193,54,13,206,34,41,36,166,241,99,106,113,69,217,61,7,33,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
