In the Hindustani realm, the santoor is closely associated with Shivkumar Sharma and the rudra vina with Zia Mohiuddin Khan, but historically, perhaps the closest and most intimate association has been with Bismillah Khan and the shehnai.\n\nBorn in 1916, he has raised the status of one of India's most distinctively voiced instruments unprecedentedly. In its folk form this double-reeded instrument is used on a variety of ritual occasions but is especially associated with weddings. Bismillah Khan has recorded extensively and like many Indian classical artists most of his early work was released by EMI India or its overseas partners. His historic jugalbandi with Vilayat Khan was chosen to inaugurate the Music of India series on EMI India's parent company in Britain. This series licensed the work of masters such as Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and Nikhil Banerjee. The debut release in the Music of India series, however, featured in the terminology of the album duettos on &quot;Chaiti-Dhun&quot; and &quot;Bhairavee Thumree.&quot; The third in the series was another shehnai jugalbandi, this time with violinist V.G. Jog. It was a further indication of the esteem in which Bismillah Khan was held. Time has only reinforced that.\n\n01 Raga_ Baiagi Bhairav.mp3\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 25.6 MiB\nDuration                                 : 13mn 46s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 260 Kbps\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nDuration                                 : 13mn 46s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 260 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                         : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 25.6 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                        : -m s -V 0 -q 0 -lowpass 19.5 --vbr-new -b 32\n\np.s. when I put mouse over the tracks of this album it says 320 kbps, but mediaainfo says 256 plus.... so......:-D\n\nEnjoii and as always apprec any comments .\n\nCheers:-D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba57b99a8e28451a4ede80cc057ecab64ed14bec","amp;dn":"%09Ustad+Bismillah+Khan+n+Party+-+Shehnai+Nawaz+1999+Vinylrip+Rema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba57b99a8e28451a4ede80cc057ecab64ed14bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,87,185,154,142,40,69,26,78,222,128,204,5,126,202,182,78,209,75,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
