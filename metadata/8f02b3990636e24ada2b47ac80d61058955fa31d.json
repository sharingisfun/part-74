As a response, a vibrant Do It Yourself movement has risen to reclaim age old traditions that reconnect us to slower and simpler times. A sewing renaissance has been set in motion at a time in history when economic instability and an awareness of the importance of using sustainable resources is peaking.\n\nWith this in mind, award-winning blogger Maya Donenfeld offers a guide to working with her favorite recycled materials. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find linen, burlap, wool and more with details on their history, deconstruction techniques, sewing tips, and information about their environmental impact.\n\nReinventing everyday materials into extraordinary items of beauty and utility for the modern home and family will excite new and experienced sewers alike. To add an element of personalization, Maya draws on her experience leading print workshops to share easy methods for transforming gently-used fabric with paint and ink. Stenciling templates and thorough instructions are provided, as well as encouragement to invent your own designs. Stories, a favorite recipe, and nature activity are tucked between and around the projects to offer the reader an invitation to slow down, and create with intention.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f02b3990636e24ada2b47ac80d61058955fa31d","amp;dn":"Reinvention%3A+Sewing+with+Rescued+Materials+%7Eariane_c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f02b3990636e24ada2b47ac80d61058955fa31d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,2,179,153,6,54,226,74,218,43,71,172,128,214,16,88,149,95,163,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
