In The First Muslim, Lesley Hazleton brings him vibrantly to life. Drawing on early eyewitness sources and on history, politics, religion, and psychology, she renders him as a man in full, in all his complexity and vitality.\n       HazletonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account follows the arc of MuhammadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise from powerlessness to power, from anonymity to renown, from insignificance to lasting significance. How did a child shunted to the margins end up revolutionizing his world? How did a merchant come to challenge the established order with a new vision of social justice? How did the pariah hounded out of Mecca turn exile into a new and victorious beginning? How did the outsider become the ultimate insider?\n       Impeccably researched and thrillingly readable, HazletonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative creates vivid insight into a man navigating between idealism and pragmatism, faith and politics, nonviolence and violence, rejection and acclaim. The First Muslim illuminates not only an immensely significant figure but his lastingly relevant legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2730e2ec85f32693900c55d1a9435610aec0d4e","amp;dn":"The.First.Muslim.The.Story.of.Muhammad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2730e2ec85f32693900c55d1a9435610aec0d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,115,14,46,200,95,50,105,57,0,197,93,26,148,53,97,10,236,13,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
