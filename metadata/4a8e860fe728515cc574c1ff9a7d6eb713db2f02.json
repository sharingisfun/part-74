Our antihero, Jimmy (Phil Daniels), a teenager dissatisfied with family, work, and love. He spends his time knocking around with his clothes-obsessed, pill-popping, scooter-driving fellow mods, a group whose antipathy for the motorcycle-riding rockers leads to a climactic riot in Brighton. Director Franc Roddam's rough-edged film is a quintessential chronicle of youthful rebellion and turmoil, with Pete Townshend's brilliant songs (including &quot;I've Had Enough,&quot; &quot;5:15,&quot; and &quot;Love, Reign O'er Me&quot;) providing emotional support, and featuring Sting and Ray Winstone in early roles.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nNew Audio Commentary Featuring Director Fran Roddam and Brian Tufano\nTrailers\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
