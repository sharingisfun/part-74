The code is written in PDP-11 assembler; thus, you'll need a PDP-11 emulator and compiler to get it running. OCR might not work on this, so be prepared to type many, MANY lines of code by hand into your favorite text editor for compilation.\n\nOf course, if you're just interested in ancient (comparativly [no, I'm not a dictionary] speaking) computer history, then there's no need to worry about copying out every line in the file unless you want something more readable, as some of the sections are somewhat... light on the ink/scan (fading due to age is a possible cause).\n\nAnd hey, I've made 3 torrents! 3!
