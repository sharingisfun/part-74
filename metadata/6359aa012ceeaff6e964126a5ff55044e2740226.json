Like numerous Southern California groups in the mid-'60s, the Hondells, despite numerous picture sleeves, were not a bonafide group. Their recordings were put together by floating lineups of Los Angeles session men, overseen by producer Gary Usher. &quot;Little Honda&quot; itself featured ace guitarists Glen Campbell and Richie Podolor, as well as drummer Hal Blaine. Hondells groups were put together for live performance in the wake of &quot;Little Honda,&quot; but session musicians such as Podolor were always present on the recordings.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hondells-p25236/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hondells-p25236/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/vol-3-aliases-and-alternatives-r813400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/vol-3-aliases-and-alternatives-r813400&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000028COD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000028COD&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
