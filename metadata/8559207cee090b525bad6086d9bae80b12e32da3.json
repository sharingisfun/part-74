The addition of Richard Hammond and James May completed the Top Gear dream team and ratings soared as viewers tuned in to see the latest Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, arguments over the Cool Wall, and Power Laps by the mysterious Stig. Recent seasons have been defined by their madcap challenges with predictably hilarious results. Hour-long specials such as the 1,000-mile journey across Africa in cars bought for less than $2,500, and a race to the magnetic North Pole in which Clarkson and May became the first people to drive a motor vehicle to the Pole, have cemented Top Gear's reputation as much more than just a car show.\n\nBut the show's most shocking moment came in 2006, when Hammond suffered serious head injuries while driving a Vampire turbojet drag racing car at over 300mph. From a humble beginning as a 1970s car show, to achieving world domination, this is the full story.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8559207cee090b525bad6086d9bae80b12e32da3","amp;dn":"The+Top+Gear+Story+-+Martin+Roach+-+Epub+-+Mr+Festus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8559207cee090b525bad6086d9bae80b12e32da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,89,32,124,238,9,11,82,91,173,96,134,217,186,232,11,18,227,45,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
