Now Jennie is in search of a simpler life, as she moves her family to a seven-acre farm in the countryside of Central California, where she hopes to put the pressures of Hollywood aside and experience a new way of life. It's a move that will either give her the all-American lifestyle she has always dreamed of, or turn her family's world completely upside down.\n\n\n\nNote -- The first episode I couldn't find in any format except .flv so I just converted it to a .mp4. Let me know if there are any issues and I can just upload the original .flv if so. I will be uploading the rest of the season this week. :)\n\nThank you to the original cappers of these files! \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f15e7666c80f4d1832b5cbe446b4f746f93bcae2","amp;dn":"Jennie.Garth.A.Little.Bit.Country.S01E05.Anger.Management.WS.DSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f15e7666c80f4d1832b5cbe446b4f746f93bcae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,94,118,102,200,15,77,24,50,181,203,228,70,180,247,70,249,59,202,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
