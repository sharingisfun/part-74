Now repackaged with a new introduction from bestselling author Hampton Sides to coincide with a major HBO dramatic film of the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. \n\nBury My Heart at Wounded Knee is Dee BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic, eloquent, meticulously documented account of the systematic destruction of the American Indian during the second half of the nineteenth century. A national bestseller in hardcover for more than a year after its initial publication, it has sold over four million copies in multiple editions and has been translated into seventeen languages. Using council records, autobiographies, and firsthand descriptions, Brown allows great chiefs and warriors of the Dakota, Ute, Sioux, Cheyenne, and other tribes to tell us in their own words of the series of battles, massacres, and broken treaties that finally left them and their people demoralized and decimated. A unique and disturbing narrative told with force and clarity, \n\nBury My Heart at Wounded Knee changed forever our vision of how the West was won, and lost. It tells a story that should not be forgotten, and so must be retold from time to time. \n\n[color=Maroon][u][b]OUT OF APPRECIATION; PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT, THANK YOU...[/b][/u][/color]\n\n\n[color=Purple][center][b]WE ALL NEED A HEALTHY PLANET, HEALTHY PEOPLE AND PROTECT OUR ANIMALS IN HONOR OF MOTHER EARTH![/b][/center][/color]\n\n\n[color=Teal][b][center]ENJOY AND I WISH YOU LONGEVITY[/center][/b][/color]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d19242bc1620d4de284d03b357495cc75f080de3","amp;dn":"NATIVE+AMERICAN+INDIANS%3A+BURY+MY++HEART+%40+WOUNDED+KNEE%2C+AUDIO+%26a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d19242bc1620d4de284d03b357495cc75f080de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,146,66,188,22,32,212,222,40,77,3,179,87,73,92,199,95,8,13,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
