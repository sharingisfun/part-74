They each had their biggest hit single -- The Knockouts' &quot;Darling Lorraine,&quot; The Genies' &quot;Who's That Knocking&quot; -- in 1959, and followed it with a handful of similar-sounding releases. Neither group really had national fame, but they each made a couple of good records that should be of interest to hardcore doo-wop collectors. And that's the reason why this disc is of interest -- despite its uneven material, haphazard packaging and indifferent sound, it has a couple of gems from both groups that makes it worth seeking out.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r371765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r371765&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000009QJ7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000009QJ7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
