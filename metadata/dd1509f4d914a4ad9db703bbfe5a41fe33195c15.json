A verse-play, published in 1965, Loona is based on the legend of Puran Bhagat.\n\n        The Legend:\n\n        King of Sialkot marries a young girl Loona. She falls for his son (from 1st wife) Puran who is of her age. He declines her advances; she complains abt him; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s punished (hands/feet amputated and thrown into a well). A guru rescues him; he gets well and becomes a Bhagat. Years later, Loona still childless comes to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the BhagatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The truth comes out; she admits her mistake; he forgives them and wishes a child, Rasalu.\n\n    ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how the legend of Puran Bhagar has been told in Punjab for nearly two thousand years. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not how Shiv tells is. For Shiv, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the legend of Loona: a girl of lower caste, married against her wishes, falls in love with a man of her age. So what? he asks and retells the legend and makes it about Loona, not the prince-turned-bhagat. A masterpiece at the age of 28! ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called a great poet.\n\n    Enjoii and as always apprec any valuable comments and/or ek button hai jiska naam hai......................\n\n\nCheers\n\n[/CENTER]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1509f4d914a4ad9db703bbfe5a41fe33195c15","amp;dn":"Shiv+Kumar+Batalvis+Loona+OR+Luna+Punjabi+Folksie+Bhupinder+n+Mi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1509f4d914a4ad9db703bbfe5a41fe33195c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,21,9,244,217,20,164,173,157,183,3,187,254,90,65,254,51,25,92,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
