When DJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents travel on the eve of Halloween and the abusive nanny Zee stays with him, he calls his clumsy best friend Chowder to play basketball. But when the ball falls in NebbercrackerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawn, the old man has a siege, and soon they find that the house is a monster. Later the boys rescue the smart Jenny from the house and the trio unsuccessfully tries to convince the babysitter, her boyfriend Bones and two police officers that the haunted house is a monster, but nobody believes them. The teenagers ask their video-game addicted acquaintance Skull how to destroy the house, and they disclose its secret on the Halloween night.\n\nGenre: Animation | Comedy | Family | Fantasy | Mystery\nIMDB Rating: 6.7/10 from 41,523 users Metascore: 68/100\nDirected by: Gil Kenan\nStarring: Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, Spencer Locke\n\nRelease Name: Monster.House.2006.iNTERNAL.BDRip.XviD-EXViDiNT\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: AVI | 624Ãƒâ€”256 | 909 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 158 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 30mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2938634a5d5d08ec4bb71a49dc90e0569ee26e","amp;dn":"Monster+House+2006+iNTERNAL+BDRip+XviD-EXViDiNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe2938634a5d5d08ec4bb71a49dc90e0569ee26e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,41,56,99,74,93,93,8,236,75,183,26,73,220,144,224,86,158,226,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
