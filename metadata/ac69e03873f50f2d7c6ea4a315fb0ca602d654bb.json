You will need to fight for survival while exploring the dark and claustrophobic environments both at sea and as the action moves to dry land. \nTaking place in 2005, between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the action centers on BSAA member Jill Valentine and introduces her new partner Parker Luciani. They have been sent to search for Chris Redfield, whose last known GPS data positions him as being on the ship. Far from being empty, danger lurks around every corner as Jill and Parker explore the confined space of the ship and must face a menacing new enemy that emerges from the darkness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac69e03873f50f2d7c6ea4a315fb0ca602d654bb","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+Revelations+Demo+RGH%2CJTAG%2CLT%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac69e03873f50f2d7c6ea4a315fb0ca602d654bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,105,224,56,115,245,15,45,124,110,164,163,21,251,12,166,2,214,84,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
