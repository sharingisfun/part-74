Last Chance Before (3:50)\n\nA journey into connective contrast, the Oxymoron LP is Justice and Metro's best collaborative work to date. A refined exploration of self, history and the unmistakable MJAZZ sound. Paradoxically both future and retro, a true oxymoron.\n\nSupport from DJ Flight, Blocks, ASC, Sam KDC, Code and Jason oS.\n\n&quot;The Oxymoron LP is a total nod to our early days in rave in dodgy clubs and shady house parties in and around Luton and London. The sounds being played were a heady mix of lots of different genres, Acid, Breakbeat, House, Hardcore, Hip Hop were all played back to back in no order but somehow they all went, they maybe shouldn't have but they did, dark and light, bitter sweet, oxymorons in sound.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Justice &amp; Metro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd68a221832c3aef56082a5a9d4667495259afc","amp;dn":"Justice+and+Metro+-+Oxymoron+%282013%29+FLAC+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd68a221832c3aef56082a5a9d4667495259afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,214,138,34,24,50,195,174,245,96,130,165,169,212,102,116,149,37,154,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
