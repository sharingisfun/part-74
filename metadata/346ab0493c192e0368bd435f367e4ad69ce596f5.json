We are now one month from Mageia 3 final release, so your tests - and reports! - are more important than ever.\n\nThis beta release comes with nearly all the designs for Mageia 3 integrated - many thanks to Leo who made the background image for Mageia 2 and then worked again on the Mageia 3 design. Our thanks to him for his patience and for his contribution!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:346ab0493c192e0368bd435f367e4ad69ce596f5","amp;dn":"Mageia+3+beta4+dual+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"346ab0493c192e0368bd435f367e4ad69ce596f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,106,176,73,60,25,46,3,104,189,67,95,54,126,74,214,156,229,150,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
