Hubbard's regular group of the time (with James Spaulding on alto and flute, pianist Albert Dailey, bassist Bob Cunningham, and drummer Otis Ray Appleton, plus guest conga player Ray Barretto) performs the debut version of his famous &quot;Little Sunflower,&quot; an excellent remake of &quot;Up Jumped Spring,&quot; and four lesser-known pieces. Hubbard and Spaulding made for an excellent team and there are plenty of exciting moments on this brief but potent set. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nBacklash\nThe Return of the Prodigal Son\nLittle Sunflower\nOn the Que-Tee\nUp Jumped Spring\nEchoes of Blue\n\nFreddie Hubbard - trumpet, flugelhorn\nJames Spaulding - alto saxophone, flute\nAlbert Dailey - piano\nBob Cunningham - bass\nRay Appleton - drums\nRay Barretto - conga\n\nI'm not exactly sure about the release year (2000), it might be the one from 2002. It doesn't really matter, it sounds great.\n\nEnjoy and share!
