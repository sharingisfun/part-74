Between the band's 16 albums and DVDs, Triumph has received 18 gold and 9 platinum awards in Canada and the United States. Triumph was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including Group of the Year Award in 1979, 1985, 1986 and 1987.\n\nLike their fellow Canadians Rush, Triumph began building their reputation across North America as a live band, peaking in the early to mid-1980s. The band was formed by Toronto music veterans Gil Moore (drums, vocals), Mike Levine (bass, keyboards), and Rik Emmett (guitar, vocals) in 1975.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRock &amp; Roll Machine was the second album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1977. The album was released on RCA Records in the US in 1978 and again on MCA Records (MCA-1455) in 1980. The album resulted in the band's first hit single, a cover version of Joe Walsh's &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. Depending on the country of issue, the album may also be named Rock and Roll Machine or Rock 'N' Roll Machine. The MCA issue is noteworthy in that the album was re-mastered by Bob Ludwig at his Masterdisk location as opposed to the original RCA which was mastered by Jack Adelman at RCA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa5b5161e3df13e3e4b58e4c2dd48fa4703d420","amp;dn":"Triumph+-+Rock+And+Roll+Machine+%5B1977%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa5b5161e3df13e3e4b58e4c2dd48fa4703d420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,165,181,22,30,61,241,62,62,75,88,228,194,221,72,250,71,3,212,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
