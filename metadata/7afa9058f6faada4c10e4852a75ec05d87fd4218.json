With this software, unsafe processes can be determined by rating of danger.\nThe program is also able to detect a process that contains and executes alien code of another process. Users can view the detailed information about any selected process and detect all hidden threats, including spyware, malware, keyloggers and trojans. \nUnlike the standard Windows Task Manager, Spyware Process Detector will also detect transparent processes and tasks. The security rating is color-coded so that users can easily see the most dangerous processes.\nRed stands for the highest rating of danger, green for the lowest one, any color between red and green stands for varying levels of security threat. The program shows other details about each process, such as process ID, parent ID, security status, EXE filename, file path, description etc. \n\n-------[Requirements]----------------------------------\n\nIntel Pentium processor or higher (Intel Pentium II 500 MHz processor or higher recommended)\n\n32MB of RAM or above (128MB or above recommended)\n\nUp to 3MB of available hard-disk space\n\n-------[What's New in This Release]--------------------\n\nFixed crash bug with empty startup filename.\n\n\n-------------------\n-:[Install Notes]:-\n-------------------\n==&gt; Run the setup\n==&gt; After Install Don't Start/Lunch Program\n==&gt; Now Run Activator\n==&gt; Enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afa9058f6faada4c10e4852a75ec05d87fd4218","amp;dn":"Spyware+Process+Detector+3.23.2+With+Activator+%28KaranPc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afa9058f6faada4c10e4852a75ec05d87fd4218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,250,144,88,246,250,173,164,193,14,72,82,167,94,192,93,135,253,66,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
