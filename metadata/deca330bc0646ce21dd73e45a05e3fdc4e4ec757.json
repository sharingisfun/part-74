Actually, the majority of them were billed to both AmÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ© Ardoin and fiddler Dennis McGee, though Ardoin was the solo artist for some of the tracks. Remastered from the original 78s of three collectors, there's still some unavoidable surface noise and other imperfections, but the sound is as good as it's likely to get with the technology available at the time of this 2010 release. The less specialized music fan might be better off hearing a track, or a few tracks, by Ardoin on a compilation rather than his entire output, as the similarity of the songs might prove daunting all at once. Nonetheless, the soulfulness of his voice and playing cuts through the age of the source material, with appreciative liner notes summarizing what relatively little is known about his life (as well as including the one known picture of Ardoin).\n\n01 - Madam Atchen\n02 - One Step Des Chameaux\n03 - Valse De Mon Vieux Village\n04 - Les Blues De Voyages\n05 - Taunt Aline\n06 - One Step D'Oberlin\n07 - Valse De Ballard\n08 - Aimez Moi Ce Soir\n09 - Amadie Two Step\n10 - Valse Brunette\n11 - Sunset\n12 - Blues De Basille\n13 - Valse Des Chantiers\n14 - Les Blues De Crowley\n15 - Valse De Gueydan\n16 - La Turtape De Saroied\n17 - Two Step De Eunice\n18 - Two Step De Prairie Solieau\n19 - Valse Des Opelousas\n20 - Le Midland Two-Step\n21 - La Valse De Amites\n22 - Two Step De Mama\n23 - Valse A Alcee Poulard\n24 - Les Blues Prison\n25 - Si Dur D'etre Seul\n26 - La Valse A Austin Ardoin\n27 - Tortope D'Osrun\n28 - Tout Que Rest C'est Mon Linge\n29 - La Valse A Thomas\n30 - Tostape De Jennings\n31 - Oberlin\n32 - Two Step D'Elton\n33 - Valse De La Point D'Eglise\n34 - La Valse Ah Abe\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mama-ill-be-long-gone-the-complete-recordings-of-amede-ardoin-1929-1934-am-d-ardoin/21577239?ean=894807002554&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mama-ill-be-long-gone-the-complete-recordings-of-amede-ardoin-1929-1934-am-d-ardoin/21577239?ean=894807002554&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deca330bc0646ce21dd73e45a05e3fdc4e4ec757","amp;dn":"Amede+Ardoin+-+Mama%2C+I%27ll+Be+Long+Gone+%281929-1934%29+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deca330bc0646ce21dd73e45a05e3fdc4e4ec757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,202,51,11,192,100,108,226,29,215,62,69,160,94,63,220,78,78,199,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
