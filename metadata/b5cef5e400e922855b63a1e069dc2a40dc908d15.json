Foster shows off the influence of John Coltrane (as opposed to his earlier cool-toned style) and matches well with the occasionally fiery trumpet of Virgil Jones, pianist Albert Dailey, bassist Bob Cunningham and drummer Alan Dawson. In addition to Fats Waller's &quot;Jitterbug Waltz,&quot; Foster performs five originals, some of which (like &quot;Raunchy Rita&quot;) fall into the area of funky hard bop. Spirited music.\n\nTrack list:\n01. Raunchy Rita\n02. Janie Huk\n03. Thingaroo\n04. Baby Ann\n05. Jitterbug Waltz\n06. Disapproachment\n\nPersonnel:\nFrank Foster - tenor sax\nVirgil Jones - trumpet\nAl Dailey - piano\nBob Cunningham - bass\nAlan Dawson - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
