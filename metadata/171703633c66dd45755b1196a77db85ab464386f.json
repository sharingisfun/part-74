It is based on the 1885 book The Gypsy Baron by MÃƒÂ³r JÃƒÂ³kai, about the romance between a poor Hungarian aristocrat and a mysterious Roma-looking Turkish girl in the 18th century. Music from Johann Strauss II's operetta The Gypsy Baron, based on the same novel, is used for the film's soundtrack.\n\nReview:\n\nSzaffi is a full-length animated feature based on Jokai Mor's books Gypsy Baron (Cyganibaro) and Szaffi. I don't want to tell the details of story here, because it's best you see it for yourself. It has adventure, and treasure, and love, and a little black cat, and a war, and picturesque villains - a governor with a pressure release valve in his skull and a fat pig-loving baron, and of course, the good gypsies. All of us soviet children saw this cartoon when it was shown on Russian TV back in the 80's and every character is in our memory forever. Puritan Americans be warned, there is some innocent (and properly masked by 'random' objects) nudity in the cartoon.\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet \nGroup/Ripper: ThanxXx to the Original Ripper!\nVideo Format: AVI/XviD \nVideo Bitrate: 1152 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps \nAspect Ratio: 8:7\nResolution: 576 x 416\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.122\nAudio Format: 0x0055 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate: 106.59 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48000 Hz\n\nCheck SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!\n\n(K) Kopyleft 2013 - All Rites Reversed...\n\np.s.
