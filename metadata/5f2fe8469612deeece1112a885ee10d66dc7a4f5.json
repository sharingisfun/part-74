The kids in Odyssey will find out even while the town is buzzing with competition. A scavenger hunt pits Matthew, Jay, and Barrett against each other in a musical extravaganza. Can Barrett take his eyes off the prize to focus on whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truly important? Meanwhile, Olivia struggles to show &quot;brotherly love&quot; when Matthew wants to take away her role as WootonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camp assistant and Eugene must decide how to be honest when Connie showers him with a string of gifts...that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand. Integrity, trust, and forgiveness are all put to the test as the folks in Odyssey learn the lessons of 1 Corinthians 13.
