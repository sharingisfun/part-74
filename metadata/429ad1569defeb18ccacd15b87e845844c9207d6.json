Working out of an apartment in Valencia, Spain, the two recorded a self-titled five-song EP that nodded to the retro-loungy puffiness of Black Moth Super Rainbow, the rainbow-tinted ambience of the Flaming Lips, and the ethereal synthiness of groups like Galaxie 500 and Stereolab. The disc was released on the Bedroom Classics label in 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429ad1569defeb18ccacd15b87e845844c9207d6","amp;dn":"She%27s+Spanish%2C+I%27m+American+-+She%27s+Spanish%2C+I%27m+American+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429ad1569defeb18ccacd15b87e845844c9207d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,154,209,86,157,239,235,24,204,172,209,91,135,232,69,132,76,146,7,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
