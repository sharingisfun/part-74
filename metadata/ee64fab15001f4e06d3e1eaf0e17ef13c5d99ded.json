The idea\nwas that these kinds of documents took great effort to assemble and needed\nsome protection. \n\nSince then, copyright maximalists have extended what copyright covers, and \nextended its duration.  The current situation is absurd. \n\nOne silly outcome is that the benefits of copyright extension do not \nactually benefit the original authors. In most cases, the literary agent, \nor publisher, or perhaps the authors estate are the only beneficiaries. \n\nSubverting a bad law is every citizens duty.
