It consists of a selection of songs from Foreman's previous solo EP releases, handpicked by Foreman and his fans, who were given a chance to vote for which songs to be included. Foreman also recorded two new songs for the release. &quot;It's for all the folks that have a hard time understanding EP's and want things in a more universal format,&quot; explained Foreman.\nIt has peaked so far at No. 48 on the iTunes overall albums chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6395b91073dacc6163a1f47e5a8e890d5d21a0da","amp;dn":"Jon+Foreman+-+Limbs+%26amp%3B+Branches+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6395b91073dacc6163a1f47e5a8e890d5d21a0da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,149,185,16,115,218,204,97,99,161,244,126,90,142,137,13,93,33,160,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
